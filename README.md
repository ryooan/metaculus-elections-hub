# Metaculus World Map
A prototype for a Metaculus World Map, which gives the ability to veiw Metaculus questions geographically. Live at: https://www.ryanbeckauthor.com/metaculus-world-map/

The world map sorts questions by activity, just like in the Metaculus feed, but also gives the ability to view them geographically by country as well as filtering by category. This provides the ability to see the most popular questions pertaining to each country (assessed crudely by keyword search in the question text and resolution criteria).
