/questions/172/will-online-voting-spread-in-the-us-before-the-next-presidential-election/,Will online voting spread in the US before the next presidential election?,forecast,172,0.0,,RESOLVED,0.02,"Although critical to the democratic model of government, voting in America has some problems. Turnout is often low, and the terms ""butterfly ballot"" and ""hanging chad"" still linger in our collective consciousness following the uncertainty of the 2000 presidential election. 

Since we are already able to do practically everything else via the internet –bank, shop, communicate, etc., – online voting seems like a natural next step. Some argue that online voting would increase turnout and bring voting access to anyone with the internet, without the need to go to a polling place on Election Day. 

Currently, [22 states](http://www.businessinsider.com/22-states-that-allow-you-to-vote-online-2016-9) allow for some form of online voting, allowing members of the military and other citizens living overseas to return their ballots by email. Only one state - Alaska - allows any registered voter, provided they pre-register, to use an online voting portal. Four other states offer an online voting portal. In March 2016 the Utah Republican Party [offered online voting](https://www.wired.com/2016/03/security-experts-arent-going-like-utahs-online-primary/) to all registered voters in its presidential caucus. 

The major problem that hampers [every proposal](https://www.verifiedvoting.org/resources/internet-voting/) for online voting is security. Repeated analyses find that, given the impossibility of sufficiently protecting the millions of personal devices that would be used in an online election, the risk of malicious interference in the election is too high to recommend proceeding with online voting. The stakes are also too high, the analysts say, with no less than the balance of American political power in play. 

Still, [multiple](http://www.everyonecounts.com/introduction-to-elect/) online voting [vendors](https://www.electionsonline.com/) exist, each claiming to be secure. The fate of online voting may depend on who can make the most innovative advances in internet security: vendors or hackers.

Mueller's investigation will likely put further pressure on the Administration, and a possible recession with a currently strong economy would be disastrous. 

But all is not lost for Trump. Approval ratings have been historically mean-reverting, with initially unpopular presidents slowly gaining popularity as their presidency continues. BIll Clinton had a [sub-40% approval rating](http://www.gallup.com/poll/116677/presidential-approval-ratings-gallup-historical-statistics-trends.aspx) six months into his presidency, but eventually rebounded to 60% by the end of his presidency. Even after Ford's rating tanked after his pardoning of Nixon, he managed to (barely) crawl above 50% approval. By keeping further scandals to a minimum, maintaining a strong economy and earning some policy victories, Trump could slowly rebound over the next three years.

On a more morbid note, Bush's popularity skyrocketed after the 9/11 attacks in a ""Rally Around the Flag"" effect.  Another major terrorist attack could likewise spike Trump's popularity, at least temporarily.

> The special thing about satellites and the organizations that control or operate them (Air Force Space Command, the NRO, and other smaller outfits) is that they are, by nature, subordinate to other branches of the armed forces—to wars that are fought not in outer space but on Earth or in the atmosphere. Space assets service air, naval, and ground forces by providing them with intelligence, communications, and guidance for missiles and smart bombs. Placing these vital assets under the command of a four-star general in a separate service—and imbuing its officers and enlisted personnel with the élan of an elite force that doesn’t answer to the other services of the armed forces and that, in fact, competes with them for resources—would run counter to the nation’s needs.

Recently, [there has been a fracture in the Conservative Party of Canada](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/bernier-statement-conserative-1.4795894): the libertarian-leaning MP from Quebec, Maxime Bernier, left the party over complaints that it is ""morally and intellectually corrupt"" and beholden to special interest groups whom they serve at the public's expense. Bernier's acrimonious departure came after the Conservative Party caucus — mostly notably leader Andrew Scheer, [who beat Bernier by two percentage points during a 2017 leadership race](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/05/27/maxime-bernier-leads-tory-leadership-race-after-first-ballot-andrew-scheer-second.html) — [distanced themselves from him](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/conservative-bernier-caucus-scheer-1.4795623) in the wake of blowback to his comments addressing what he called the ruling Liberal party's policies of ""extreme diversity"".

Bernier has [declared his intentions to form his own federal political party and field candidates in all 338 of Canada's federal ridings](https://nationalpost.com/opinion/maxime-bernier-why-my-new-political-movement-because-canada-has-been-hijacked).

A poll of a thousand Canadians shortly after he announced his intention to form a party found [13% of Canadians intended to cast their vote for its candidates](http://abacusdata.ca/will-max-bernier-be-a-spoiler-for-the-conservative-party/). While this is an impressive start, it's clear that Bernier has an uphill battle ahead of him in order to ascend to the Prime Ministership, or even to the Leader of the Official Opposition, a position currently occupied by his formal rival Scheer. 

One big boost to Bernier's candidacy would be an endorsement from Canadian intellectual Jordan Peterson, [who is arguably the most well-known and popular intellectual in the Western world today](https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2018/03/16/jordan-peterson-is-trying-to-make-sense-of-the-world-including-his-own-strange-journey.html). His work — which is often articulated in bombastic popular lectures — covers topics such as free speech, identity, anti-totalitarianism, personality, performance, and religion, among many others. Peterson's reach is considerable: his lectures have been viewed nearly 70 million times on YouTube, and his new book, 12 Rules for Life, has sold over half a million copies. 

Peterson and Bernier have crossed paths before. Bernier cited a meeting with Jordan Peterson has having [changed his mind on endorsing Bill C-16](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/conservative-leadership-maxime-bernier-c-16-gender-1.3981691), which amends the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code to include the terms ""gender identity"" and ""gender expression"". [He met Peterson again and was photographed with him this past April at an event in Montreal](https://twitter.com/maximebernier/status/989970810679984128?lang=en), where he says the two of them spoke on the topic of freedom of speech. 

[Peterson considers himself to be a ""classical liberal""](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/jordan-peterson-claims-hes-no-conservative/), while Maxime resists political labelling but has suggested he himself might [reasonably be called a freedom-loving fiscal conservative, or a ""reasonable libertarian""](https://www.cbc.ca/news/opinion/breakfast-with-bernier-1.3931417). Both share a dislike for the policies and perspectives of the current Prime Minster, Justin Trudeau, and his Liberal Party. 

While there is perhaps not much political space between Bernier and Peterson, its not clear that Peterson is in the business of offering political endorsements. He seems not to have made any publicly during the 2015 Canadian federal election. He did say, when asked, that he would be [open to endorsing candidate Tanya Granic Allen during the Ontario Progressive Conservative party's leadership race earlier this year](https://www.pressreader.com/canada/ottawa-citizen/20180301/281621010832293), but no such endorsement ever came.

Peterson's ideas have already had a large impact on Canadian politics at the federal and provincial level. It no doubt informed the pushback among federal Conservatives on Bill C-16, and has fueled the concerns of both federal and provincial conservatives regarding the [challenges to freedom of speech on the country's university campuses](https://globalnews.ca/news/3872432/andrew-scheer-laurier-university-free-speech/).

Her most recent, fourth cabinet was formed with the votes of CDU/CSU and SPD, a so-called grand coalition.

A brief overview on her:

Merkel entered politics shortly after the Berlin Wall fell, joining a local political party that later united with the CDU. She stood for election in her constituency shortly after reunification of former East Germany with West Germany, becoming a member of Bundestag, a position she’s held since 1991. In the CDU and parliament she was quickly recognised for her competency and appointed Minister for Women and Youth by Helmut Kohl, later promoted to Minister for the Environment and Nuclear Safety. 

With the defeat of the CDU federal elections in 1998 Merkel became secretary-general in her party, a prominent and powerful position. She was elected party leader of the CDU in 2000, after her patron (and also former party leader) Kohl and his chosen successor in the CDU tripped over a party funding scandal. She didn’t become contender for chancellor for the following election because of party politics, but ran in 2005, when she won a hair’s breadth victory.

She’s now the third longest running chancellor, and will be the second longest if her cabinet lasts till the end of the current Bundestag. 

Given the recent controversies and [the rise of populist right-wing party AfD](https://www.infratest-dimap.de/en/analyses-results/nationwide/vote-intention/) that isn’t a given, though. If there was a federal election, the AfD would be the second strongest party after CDU/CSU, and a [grand coalition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_coalition_(Germany)) would both look decidedly different than now and still result in only a minority government.

### Will the EU Parliament election 2019 be free from any unlawful and significant election manipulation attempt?

The question will resolve once the executive government is active.  ""Significant"" means that in case of success it would have moved at least one seat in the parliament.  To resolve negative any single attempt needs to be both unlawful and significant.  If no such attempt has been found until the resolution time, this question resolved positive.  If the attempt is only recognized after the new coalition has taken up operations, it resolves positive.  If the attempt would not have moved a seat, it resolves positive.  The direction of the attempt is irrelevant.  Any unquantifiable attempts would resolve positive, as would any proper marketing operations, as would if all of ""the Russians"" and ""China"" together with ""North Korean Elite Hackers"" proclaim successful operations without any other outside confirmation.

* [Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer](https://www.dw.com/en/merkel-ally-annegret-kramp-karrenbauer-urges-new-era-in-german-politics/a-46196445), the unofficial favourite,
* [Friedrich Merz](https://www.dw.com/en/friedrich-merz-makes-pitch-to-lead-cdu-after-angela-merkel/a-46108295), who had left politics a decade ago, and
* [Jens Spahn](https://www.jens-spahn.de/neustart_fuer_die_cdu), the current Minister of Health.

There are a few possibilities open right now; Merkel may choose to leave office prematurely for a successor to gain valuable experience as a chancellor. But it is doubtful if the junior partner in the coalition, the SPD, would support such a move, preferring new elections instead. Similarly the new chairman may obstruct Merkel in parliament to raise their profile for the next federal elections, possibly to the extent of triggering premature federal elections.

Thus we ask: **Will there be Federal Elections held in Germany prior to the earliest date slated for the next elections?**

One possibility is that UK will hold general elections.

In fact, he filed FEC Form 2: Statement of Candidacy with the Federal Election Commission on the day he was inaugurated in 2017, and according to NBC he has already raised more than $100 million for his  re-election campaign. https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-tops-100-million-raised-his-2020-re-election-campaign-n920661

We already have a question on whether or not Trump will be re-elected - but we don't currently have any question that will reveal expectations about the *margin* of his victory or defeat.

To win the Presidency of the United States, a candidate must obtain 270 Electoral College votes out of a potential 538. In 2016, Donald Trump was certified to have received 304 Electoral College votes.

The largest absolute number of Electoral College votes ever received by any candidate was 525, won by Ronald Reagan in 1984, 97.58% of all possible votes - but Franklin D. Roosevelt and James Monroe received a higher percentage of votes (98.49% and 99.57% respectively.)

There is a potential complication here: faithless electors. In many US States, it is legally possible for an Electoral College elector to refuse to honor the vote of their State population and to cast their vote for someone else. There have been a total of 167 instances of faithlessness as of 2018, including several in the last election in 2016. To counter this potential complication, we will say that Trump has 'won' whatever the final number of legally valid Electoral College votes certified by the United States Congress is in the first week of January 2021, accounting for the effect of any faithless electors.

This would force a special recall vote with an up-down on the recall and votes for a possible replacement.

Under California law, any elected official may be the target of a recall campaign. To trigger a recall election, proponents of the recall must gather a certain number of signatures from registered voters within a certain time period. The number of signatures statewide must equal 12% of the number of votes cast in the previous election for that office.

Under most circumstances in which a recall campaign against a statewide elected official has gathered the required number of signatures, the governor is required to schedule a special election for the recall vote. If the recall campaign qualified less than 180 days prior to the next regularly scheduled election, then the recall becomes part of that regularly scheduled election. In recall of the governor, the responsibility for scheduling a special election falls on the lieutenant governor.

The recall ballot has two components: 
* a yes or no vote for recall, and the names of replacement candidates, selected by the nomination process used in regular elections. 
* The recall measure itself is successful if it passes by a majority. In that case, the replacement candidate with a simple plurality of votes wins the office. If the recall measure fails, the replacement candidate votes are ignored.

The Cruz recall was approved for circulation by the California Secretary of State on September 6, 2019. Supporters of that recall have until February 13, 2020, to collect 1,495,709 signatures to force a recall election.

From then on the presidents mostly adhered to this tradition. 

The first deviation came at the hands of Ulysses S. Grant, who sought to serve a third term in 1880, though that was eleven years *after* he had left the oval office. A more serious case was Theodore Roosevelt. President William McKinley was assassinated still in the first year of his second term and Vice President Roosevelt had to take over. He forewent a consecutive third term, since he felt term limits were a good check on dictatorships, being succeeded by William H. Taft. But due to his dissatisfaction with President Taft’s political acumen Roosevelt sought a third term for the 1912 election, heading the Progressive Party, thus once more straining the traditional two term limits, but due to his defeat at the hands of Woodrow Wilson the tradition remained true.

Calvin Coolidge, following the sudden death of his predecessor Warren G. Harding in August 1923, was confirmed in the 1924 election, but then [chose not to run](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_do_not_choose_to_run), later on citing 10 years in Washington would be too long for any man.

Only when Franklin D. Roosevelt took over the helm was the tradition broken. Buoyed by his success in dealing with the Great Depression and trusting only his own political experience in dealing with the Nazis currently sweeping through Western Europe, he sought and won a third term in 1940. Despite being aware of his ailing health, he also sought and won a fourth consecutive term, but considered resigning once the war was over. Three months into his fourth term his health declined rapidly and he died, making place for his Vice President Harry S. Truman.

Truman took office the remaining almost full term and was reelected in 1948. In 1951 the 22nd Amendment was ratified, which would have rendered him ineligible for the 1952 election, were it not for the grandfather clause. He seriously considered running for the 1952 election, but his advisers managed to talk him out of it, citing Truman’s age and bad polling.

Only Calvin Coolidge, Harry S. Truman, and Lyndon B. Johnson forewent a term they were eligible for. Thus we ask if this will happen again.

This question asks: *Will there be any state in which Kanye West wins more votes than the difference between the first- and second-place finishers for that state?*

There is no special resolution for the cases where West does not appear on the ballot in any state, does or does not actually campaign for votes, or even if he later formally endorses another candidate -- in these cases, we will still compare the number of total votes West receives against the difference between the first- and second-place finishes for each state.

Any votes cast for West as vice president do not count; only votes for West as president.

Votes for West will be counted regardless of whether he formally appears on the ballot or campaigns as [a write-in candidate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-in_candidate).

Vote totals will be pulled from the [New York Times](nytimes.com), [CNN](cnn.com), or [FiveThirtyEight](fivethirtyeight.com) -- in the event that there is a dispute, it will be decided when the FEC eventually releases its formal election results publication (ex: https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2016.pdf but for 2020).

where \( j \) enumerates the \(M_i\) possible outcomes (i.e. possible winners) in the \(i\)th race out of N, where \(p_{ij}\) is the forecast probability of candidate \(j\) winning the \(i\)th race, and \(o_{ij}\) is assigned 1 if candidate \(j\) wins the \(i\)th race, and 0 otherwise.

\[ S = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{j=1}^{M}(p_{ij}−o_{ij})^2 \]

where \( j \) enumerates the \(M_i\) possible outcomes (i.e. possible winners) in the \(i\)th race out of N, where \(p_{ij}\) is the forecast probability of candidate \(j\) winning the \(i\)th race, and \(o_{ij}\) is assigned 1 if candidate \(j\) wins the \(i\)th race, and 0 otherwise.

For example, if The Economist assigned 52% to Trump and 48% to Biden in Texas and if Trump won then The Economist would achieve a Brier Score of
\[ S=(0.52−1)^2+(0.48−0)^2=0.4608 \]

The CDU previously led the federal government from 1949 to 1969 and 1982 to 1998. Germany's three longest-serving post-war Chancellors have all come from the CDU; Helmut Kohl (1982–1998), Angela Merkel (2005–present), and Konrad Adenauer (1949–1963). The party also leads the governments of six of Germany's sixteen states.

--[CDU, wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Democratic_Union_of_Germany)

CDU currently forms a coalition government with [CSU (Christian Social Union)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Social_Union_in_Bavaria),  and [SPD (Social Democratic Party)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany).  CDU and CSU hold an agreement that CDU does not run candidates in Bavaria, while CSU does not run candidates anywhere *besides* Bavaria.  In forming this alliance, it is not unlikely that CSU may appoint the next chancellor following the elections, even if they win fewer seats than CDU.

The two major blocks are very tightly matched at this point at 175-174. After the election in 2018 it took 134 days to form an agreement between the parties that have been in majority since then.

The speaker will make a suggestion to the parliament when he feels he has found a candidate for prime minister that the majority will accept. There is no formal time limit for this process. 
If at least 175 out of the 349 members of parliament vote against the candidate, the speaker has to come up with a new suggestion. After four votes where each candidate loses, an extra election must be announced, and the election will need to take place within 3 months.

| DATE    | DISTRICT | 2020 PRESIDENTIAL MARGIN | 2023 SPECIAL MARGIN | 20-23 SWING |
|---------|----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| 12-Sept  | NY AD27  | 13.1%     |             |             |

| 19-Sept | PA HD21  | 22.9%     |             |             |


To calculate the ""partisan vote swing"":

1. Take the margin of victory in the relevant voting district for the 2020 US presidential race. The margin of victory is defined as the percentage of the vote won by the Democratic candidate, Joe Biden, minus the percentage of the vote won by the Republican candidate, Donald Trump. This is the percentage displayed in the table above. The margin of victory is positive if Biden won the district, and negative if Trump won the district.
2. Find the margin of victory in the special election, by taking the number of votes for Democratic candidates, subtracting the number of votes for Republican candidates, and dividing the difference by the total number of votes. This will result in a percentage that is positive if the Democratic candidate receives the most votes, and negative if the Republican candidate receives the most votes.
3. Subtract the 2020 margin, calculated in step 1, from the 2023 margin, calculated in step 2. The result is the swing.

A positive swing indicates voter movement toward the Democratic party between 2020 and 2023. A negative swing indicates voter movement toward the Republican party.","If additional special elections are held, they will not be included in the count. Only the four listed races are relevant.

If any election is not held before October 1, 2023, it will not be included in the average.

The 2020 margin used will be the value listed in the table above.

The 2023 results will be sourced from credible reports and, if available, unofficial or official vote tallies from the relevant state and local agencies. Metaculus will resolve based on the most accurate figures available on September 30th and will not delay resolution for official vote counts (if they are unavailable) or recounts if they are underway on that date.",False,
