The [K2 Mission] has repurposed the Kepler spacecraft to perform successive 80-day photometric observations of selected star fields in Earth's ecliptic plane. For bright stars, K2's precision limits are similar to those of the original Kepler Mission. The first [planet detection] from the K2 Mission has recently been published.

Here's the question: 

Will a peer-reviewed publication based on K2 photometry announcing the discovery of a potentially habitable planet appear prior to January 1, 2016?

Here are some details:

For purposes of evaluation, a habitable planet is one that has a value greater than USD 1,000,000, as defined by the habitable planet [valuation formula].

$$ {\cal V }=2 \times 10^{7} \left(\frac{M_{\odot}}{M_{\star}}\right)^{1/3} \exp-\left(\frac{\log\left(\frac{M_p}{M_{\oplus}}\right)}{0.2}\right)^{1/3} \exp-\left(\frac{T_{\rm eq}-273}{30}\right)^{2}\left[2.5^{(12-V)}\right]^{1/2}\, .$$

In the above equation, V is the V-band apparent magnitude of the host star.  The planetary effective temperature is calculated using
$$T_{\rm eq}=T_{\rm{eff} \star}\left(R_{\star}/2a\right)^{1/2}[f(1-A)]^{1/4}\, $$
(following [Batalha et al], we use f=1 and A=0.3), and the planetary mass is estimated using
$$M_{\rm p}/M_{\oplus}=(R_{\rm p}/R_{\oplus})^{2.06}\, .$$

/questions/15/does-stephen-hawkings-september-paper-contain-the-essence-of-a-solution-to-the-black-hole-information-paradox/,Does Stephen Hawking's September paper contain the essence of a solution to the black hole information paradox?,forecast,15,0.0,,RESOLVED,0.19,"Hawking's famous black hole information paradox, first formulated in his [1976 paper], concerns a conflict between the reversibility of known fundamental physical laws and the irreversibility of black hole formation and evaporation.

The Standard Model of particle physics, General Relativity, quantum and classical mechanics, and most extant proposed extensions of these theories are ""unitary,"" meaning that all of the information in a system at some time can *in principle* be recovered from the same system at a later time, by running the laws of physics ""backwards.""  Black holes appear to be a possible exception:  Hawking's calculation of black hole evaporation predicts an information-free spectrum of radiation emitted, no matter what was thrown into the black hole.

Whether black holes violate unitary -- as claimed by Hawking -- has been fiercely controversial for decades.  In 2004, Hawking conceded that unitarity is preserved, based on [arguments related to the AdS/CFT correspondence].  But even if this verdict is accepted, there is no widely-accepted explanation of *how* unitarity is preserved in detail, or how information actually escapes a black hole during evaporation.

In September 2015, Hawking claimed in a [short paper] to have made a breakthrough on this topic, and presented his ideas [at a meeting], which also involved extensive discussions with eminent relativists Andy Strominger and Gary Gibbons.  The central claim is that ""the information is stored in a supertranslation associated with the shift of the horizon that the ingoing particles caused.""  Is this the key to unraveling the paradox?

The question will be resolved as ""yes"" if, by November 15, 2016, *both* Hawking's paper receives more than 100 citations, *and* any two of Leonard Susskind, John Preskill, and Raphael Bousso make statements in writing that the information paradox is essentially solved, and that the solution can be cast in terms of supertranslations defined on the horizon.

This is an excercise in combining probabilities.  

At the time of publication, we have three major contenders for the Democratic nomination: Clinton, Sanders, and O'Malley.  

Of these, only O'Malley would fit the characteristics in the question (Sanders being Jewish and Clinton female).

On the Republican side, we have Bush, Carson, Christie, Cruz, Fiorina, Gilmore, Huckabee, Kasich, Paul, Rubio, Santorum, and Trump. 

Of these, Bush, Christie, Gilmore, Huckabee, Kasich, Paul, Santorum, and Trump fit the characteristics of the question (this counts Cruz and Rubio as Hispanic.)

As a simple example, if we assume that all Democratic candidates are equally likely to receive the Democratic nomination, and all Republican candidates are equally likely to receive the Republican nomination, and that there is a 50-50 chance of a Republican or Democrat winning, then the probability for this question to resolve in the positive would be:

0.5 x (8/12) + 0.5 x (1/3) = 50%

In reality, the various probabilities are not equal and a different calculation should be done.  So what do you think: 

 **Will the next elected U.S. President be (as usual) a white, Christian, non-Hispanic man?**

For example, using a quantum computer, large numbers could in principle be factored into primes using [Shor's algorithm] in polynomial time, versus near-exponential time for classical computers; this latter inefficiency underlies the security of many encryption schemes.

A prototypical quantum computer is composed of N ""[qubits],"" or quantum mechanical bits.  Keeping these qubits operating as a closed system that retains its quantum character (without ""[decohering]"" via interactions with the environment) is a difficult challenge for more than a handful of qubits.

However, there have been a series of claims by [D-wave systems] that it had constructed quantum computers of a different type with *thousands* of qubits.
These machines cannot enact generic quantum compuing algorithms like Shor's.  However they are [claimed] to be dramatically faster at certain optimization problems.

There has been [widespread skepticism] towards D-wave's claims,  with some asserting that D-wave's system does not use quantum mechanics at all, and others arguing that even if it does, that this provides no real speedup relative to classical computers.

Nonetheless, Google has purchased D-wave systems for testing, and Google, NASA and others recently signed a [multi-year agreement] to test the systems.

On November 11, a D-wave board member [has announced] that there will be a ""watershed announcement"" at Google on Dec. 8 about quantum computing. Will this occur, and be a major change or breakthrough in computing or quantum computing?

The question resolves as ""true"" if either the [New York Times] or [Washington Post] carries a story based on Google's Announcement on the front page prior to December 15, 2015.

Conversely, difficult questions regarding how conscious or mental activity is related to brain activity (the so-called ""[hard problem]"") have led some to suppose that this mystery may be related to puzzles involving quantum mechanics.  Penrose, for example, [has argued] that the mind/brain cannot be modeled as a classical device, and that quantum effects are integral to thought.

If the brain really acts as a [quantum computer], then it should presumably contain quantum systems sufficiently isolated from their environment to retain their essential quantum nature, rather than [decohering] into effectively classical systems.  This is a challenge in the warm, wet environment of the brain, where studies [have calculated] that quantum states of electron-based systems should decohere in a tiny fraction of a second.

On the other hand, if quantum effects are potentially useful, the evolutionary drive toward high optimization is likely to have exploited them.  And indeed, there is good evidence that quantum effects [are employed] in photosynthesis and some other biological processes.

Recently, a [provocative paper] by well-known physicist [Matthew Fisher] has appeared arguing that the nuceli of atoms are sufficiently isolated from the brain environment that nuclear spins could be used to store [qubits], and manipulation of certain compounds could instantiate quantum computation.  The paper proposes several experiments that could help validate or refute the hypotheses it puts forth.

**Will this ""quantum cognition"" hypothesis be taken sufficiently seriously by the scientific community to investigate and test it?**

The question will resolve as true if, by December 1, 2016, (a) The paper attains at least 15 citations as reported by Google Scholar, and (b) a paper is published or posted on the [arXiv] reporting a completed laboratory experiment that was inspired by (and directly references) Fisher's paper.

A related result due to Turing proves that the [halting problem] (of determining whether a general computer program will halt or run forever) is undecidable in that no [Turing Machine] exists that can solve it. 

Though of deep importance in mathematics and theoretical computer science, these results have generally been considered to have few if any implications for *physics*, and by extension the natural world. (Though see [this] result in classical physics, and the extended discussions by [Penrose], [Chaitin], [Barrow], [Tegmark] and [Aaronson].)

A fascinating [new result] by Cubitt, Perez-Garcia, and Wolf (CPW; see [Nature paper] and infinitely long [arXiv paper]) suggests that the implications may be stronger than previously thought.  They prove that in certain idealized quantum systems, the existence of a finite energy ""gap"" between the ground state and first excited state is formally undecidable.  They moreover prove that as the number of lattice sites *L* increases toward infinite, a gap may appear and/or disappear at values of *L* that are undecidable.  

This result potentially calls into question standard operating procedure in many quantum many-body physics problems.  However, its applicability to realistic physical systems is as yet unclear, calling for further work.

In the next year will a paper be published establishing a new version of, extension to, or result derived from, Cubitt et al.'s theorem that applies to an actually existing physical system (including one fabricated in the lab for this purpose)?

The first paper -- submitted for publication, but as-yet not peer reviewed -- describes the serendipitous detection, using the new [ALMA] array, of a moving source in the constellation Aquila:

[Vlemmings et al. (2015) -- The serendipitous discovery of a possible new solar system object with ALMA]

The Vlemmings et al. object, which the authors of the paper have named ""Gna"", was observed in the sub-millimeter continuum at 345 GHz. It has properties that are consistent with either a Centaur-like minor planet at a roughly Uranus-like distance of 12 to 25 AU, or more intriguingly, with a large rogue planet traversing the the solar system at ~4,000 Earth-Sun distances. (A third possibility, of course, is that the source is a false alarm, or something else entirely.)

The second proposed candidate was also found with ALMA, as described in this unrefereed preprint:

[Liseau et al. (2015) -- A new submm source within a few arcseconds of α Centauri: ALMA discovers the most distant object of the solar system]

The discoverers argue that this source is either an extreme TNO (trans-Neptunian object), a super-earth sized planet, or a very cool brown dwarf in the outer realm of the solar system.

Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. Fortunately, however, if either one of these observations has actually found an planet-sized or larger object in the outer solar system, it will be easy to confirm that the object truly exists. 

On or before January 15th, 2016, will confirmation by an independent team of astronomers of one (or both) of these objects as a planetary-mass object beyond 100 AU be reported in either the New York Times or the Washington Post?

The agonized IAU deliberations vis-à-vis Pluto’s status as a ""plutoid"" or a planet or a dwarf planet constituted by far the biggest planet news of 2006. The issue of what to call an astronomical object can have important consequences. It’s unlikely that the wildly successful New Horizons Mission would have gotten its congressional funding approval if Pluto had never held the status of a named planet.

Galileo, in sighting the moons of Jupiter, made the first telescopic discovery of new worlds. He tried to increase his odds of patronage by naming his new moons “The Medicean Stars” in reference to Cosimo II de’ Medici, fourth Grand Duke of Tuscany. The ""Medicean Stars"", however, are neither medicean nor stars, and so it’s not surprising that the name failed to stick.

The International Astronomical Union has just announced [officially sanctioned names] for 31 extrasolar planets. For example, the first extrasolar planet discovered in orbit around a sunlike star, 51 Peg b, can now officially be referred to as ""Dimidium"".

There have been numerous attempts to name extrasolar planets, but none have replaced the system currently in use, in which lower-case letters are appended to the name of the parent star as successive planets are discovered, for example Gliese 876b, Gliese 876c, etc.

Will the official IAU sanction be enough to influence astronomical usage?

During the month of December, 2016, will papers published in the peer-reviewed astronomical literature refer to the 31 IAU-sanctioned planet names with greater frequency than they refer to the same 31 planets by their traditional names?

[News story here.]

The teams (comprised of the CMS and ATLAS consortia) have been accumulating data from the energetic collisions that occur when twin 6.5 TeV proton beams are directed at each other. Within the resulting subatomic collisional debris, both teams are observing an excess of 750 GeV gamma ray pairs that hint at the decay of a new type of boson that is four times heavier than the top quark.

The signal still has relatively low statistical significance, and was announced only because it was independently observed by both the CMS team and the ATLAS team. Further data are being acquired, and by Summer 2016, the signal, if it is real, will be of order 10x stronger than at present.

Will there be an announcement at or before the Aug 3-10 [38th International Conference on High-Energy Physics], that the evidence for a di-photon excess has increased, rather than decreased, in statistical significance, to 5-sigma equivalent incompatibility with the standard model? (This significance can arise from a combined analysis of CMS and Atlas data.)

A gene drive in a particular allele shows up as a bias for the corresponding phenotype in the offspring. Consider two parents with different alleles for the same gene; if there exists a gene drive for one allele, it is highly likely that all of the parents' offspring will carry the driven gene's trait. 

With new advances in genetic engineering using CRISPR, it is now much easier to modify an organism's genes. This makes *engineered* gene drives [tractable]: a gene coding for the CRISPR system itself can be encoded near to the gene being ""driven,"" so that if one copy of the driven allele and one ""wild"" allele are inherited, the CRISPR system modifies the wild gene so that the driven gene plus CRISPR system is inherited.  This process can spread the driven gene expoentially throughout a population, at a rate far exceeding the spread of a gene that is merely favorable for survival.

Uses of this method include the potential to eliminate diseases like malaria or lyme disease that are spread by a fast-reproducing vector, by promoting disease-resistant traits. [Valentino Gantz et. al.] have genetically altered a primary malaria vector native to India, the [Anopheles stephensi] mosquito, to carry and pass on anti-malaria traits. Another [study] published in nature biotechnology offers a more drastic approach that would render female [Anopheles gambiae] mosquitoes, native to Africa, completely infertile, with the intent of wiping out the species in affected ecosystems. Similar studies have investigated [engineering mice] (a prime carrier) to be immune to Lyme disease. 

With Malaria [afflicting hundreds of millions] of people per year, advances in gene drive research have insitgated public conversation about the usefulness, feasibility, and ethics of gene drives is being encouraged before testing them in wild ecosystems. By January 1st, 2018, will a formal submission be made to a regulatory body proposing to test a malaria-combatting gene drive in a wild population?

At present, the VIX stands just above 16, so very roughly speaking, this means that the market ascribes a 30% chance that stocks will have changed in price by more than 3.5% by late January 2016. 

Typically, the value of the VIX lies between 10 and 20, but it regularly spikes during times of market turmoil. During the 2008 financial crisis, for example, the VIX briefly reached values above 80.

One that is highly controversial is ""gain of function"" (GoF) pathogen research, in which researchers deliberately engineer existing pathogens to increase their virulence, transmissibility, or other qualities.  

The goal of such research is to understand the natural pathways by which existing wild pathogens may become more dangerous, so as to enhance our ability to respond, to create better vaccines, etc.  

However, there are obvious potential dangers as well, as an accidental release, or deliberate theft of such organisms could create a potential pandemic; even the information published about such efforts could increase the probability of bioterror or bioerror events.

In October 2014, the White house [issued a funding pause] on such experiments involving influenza and coronaviruses, partly in response to a statement by the [Cambridge Working Group] that called for a curtailment of experiments to create potential pandemic pathogens in the laboratory, pending a risk and benefit assessment. The White house charged the National Science Advisory Board on Biosecurity (NSABB) with commissioning such a report. 

That report has recently been [posted online] by the NSABB and its chosen contractor, Gryphon Scientific. 

On January 7-8 the NSABB will meet to consider the analysis and its response to the assessment, which will form a policy recommendation. Further discussion [will occur at the National Academy of Sciences on March 10-11].

At last count, NASA's Kepler Mission has generated [4,696 high-quality planet candidates], and thousands more are on the way from NASA's K2 and TESS Missions.

The surge in the planetary census has been almost exclusively driven by transit detections, in which the parent star is observed to undergo a subtle once-per-orbit dimming when a planet passes directly in front of the stellar disk.

Until recently, the Doppler velocity technique was the most productive method for discovering new planets. With the Doppler method, one monitors the shift in the parent star's line-of-sight velocity as it travels around the star-planet center of mass, thus allowing the presence of an unseen planet to be inferred.

The Doppler velocity technique works very well for massive planets that have short-period orbits. When the magnitude of the velocity shift lies below 1 meter per second, however, it becomes very difficult to make secure detections. Recently, a number of high-profile, front-page discoveries have been called into question.

In 2016, will a peer-reviewed paper appear in the literature that announces the detection of a non-transiting extrasolar planet that induces a radial velocity half amplitude for its parent star of less than one meter per second?

California is well-know to be very geologically active, and has in the past experienced major earthquakes: [15 recorded] since the mid-19th century above magnitude 7.0.  Even a 6.0 earthquake can cause significant damage, and there are 47 listed in the same source.

The [USGS] maintains a comprehensive searchable data store of past earthquakes around the world.  Occurrence of specific earthquakes is notoriously difficult.  However, their statistics are fairly well-characterized over long timescales: a reasonable prediction can be obtained by simply dividing taking the number of 6.0 or greater earthquakes that have occurred in the last N years and dividing by N. (For example, the [Wikipedia list] has 39 since 1900.)

Better estimates would integrate the Poisson probability distribution, would consider incompleteness in the early historical records, would consider correlated Earthquakes in the historical list, etc.

Basic physics makes such phenomena difficult: the electromagnetic repulsion between two nuclei generally prevents fusion unless there is very high energy given to at least one of them, which suggests a very high temperature.

However, that does not mean such processes are physically impossible. For example, ""[pycnonuclear reactions]"" can occur at zero temperature and ultrahigh density, muons can [catalyze fusion] at low temperatures, and the [right system] can accelerate particles at low temperature up to MeVs over a millimeter.

The possibility of cheap unlimited energy has motivated several groups to pursue the possibility of ""Low Energy Nuclear Reaction"" (LENR) energy production.  As featured in a [previous question], for the past 4 years, Andrea Rossi has been claiming to make large amounts of heat in his various ""E-Cat"" reactors, apparently inexplicable in terms of chemical reactions.  A somewhat similar LENR project is led by Robert Godes, who runs the company [Brillouin Energy].  These efforts have generated several websites such as [this one] tracking news in the field.

There is a strong consensus in the physics community that these LENR efforts have a low probability of being scientifically valid and leading  to a useful energy-generation technology.  But how low?  So we ask:

Subscribers use real-world currency to purchase playing time and in-game items.

The game grew over time, reaching 200,000 subscribers in 2008 and 500,000 in 2013. One of the game's most significant events occurred in [2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodbath_of_B-R5RB) with a massive battle over control of the B-R5RB system.

 The design calls for a pod in a low-pressure tube system; the pod rides on a cushion of air to eliminate friction with a track, and the low-pressure tube dramatically reduces air drag.  

The resulting design could achieve speeds near 760 miles per hour, taking passengers from Los Angeles to San Francisco in 35 minutes. Compare that to the [California High Speed Rail] (CHSR) project, still under construction, which aspires to make the same journey in just under three hours at around a quarter of the speed. Musk proposed the Hyperloop as not just a more ambitious and futuristic alternative to CHSR; Hyperloop aspires to be safer, cheaper, and self-powering.  

After initial skepticism, a consensus emerged that the Hyperloop idea is credible, and rather rapidly, [several independent efforts to develop the Hyperloop concept began].  At present, 
 [teams] from the U.S. and abroad are preparing to present their own Hyperloop designs at the [design weekend] at Texas A&M University. Top designs will be tested at the [SpaceX test track] (also in construction) in California. 

Meanwhile, the other two prominent hyperloop companies, Hyperloop Transportation Technologies ([HTT]) and Hyperloop Technologies Inc. ([HTI]), compete to create their own Hyperloops; these will be operational at subsonic speeds, far below 800 mph but still faster than the CHSR projected speed. This means that [prototype hyperloop technology] may be demonstrated by one or more organizations as early as 2016. 

The basic requirements that we'll use to define a Hyperloop are as follows. A pod or capsule in a tube of at least 2 m\(^2\) cross-section, suspended in an environment at pressures less than 1000 Pascals.

This world, tentatively dubbed ""Planet Nine"", is predicted to have a mass ten times that of Earth, an orbital period of about 20,000 years, and a large eccentricity (e~0.6).

The evidence for Planet Nine is indirect, and is based on alignments of known Kuiper Belt objects that are very difficult to explain through simple chance occurrence. In essence, the presence of the new planet is inferred through the gravitational sculpting that it has produced in the trajectories of small objects that lie beyond Neptune's orbit.

The current distance to Planet Nine is likely about a thousand times the Earth-Sun distance, and so if it exists, it is quite faint, explaining why it has thus far gone unnoticed. Its detection would be possible, but would require a systematic search using large telescopes such as the Keck Observatory or Subaru Observatory telescopes on Mauna Kea.

Will the discovery by direct observation of a new solar system planet having characteristics substantially similar to those described in the Batygin-Brown paper be announced in a peer-reviewed paper prior to Dec. 31, 2016?

(For this question to resolve as ""Yes"", the new planet should have an inferred radius larger than that of Earth, an orbital period greater than 5,000 years, and an orbital eccentricity e > 0.25).

""Tabby's Star"" displays severe, aperiodic dips in brightness that have so far defied conventional astrophysical explanations. 

Several explanations for this behavior have been put forward, ranging from [a family of comets] to a swarm of artificial, orbiting “[megastructures].” 

To add to the mystery, [an analysis] of historical plate data indicates this star has dimmed by nearly 0.2 magnitudes, which is ""unprecedented"" for a star of this type. (This analysis [has been criticized] at potentially being due to calibration error in the photographic plates.) 


Searches for [radio] or [other signals] from the star, featured in a [previous question], have as yet turned up nothing of note. As of March 01, 2016, no consensus explanation of this star's behavior has emerged.  

***Will a consensus emerge in 2016?***

We'll use the following criteria to specify consensus.  Let *N* be the number of refereed published journal papers that:

- provide an explanation for the aperiodic dips seen in KIC 8462852, *and*
- are cited by at least one published paper, or two preprints, supporting their explanation with additional analysis and/or data, *and*
- are cited at least 5 times in total, *and*
- are not cited by a published, refereed paper refuting the given explanation.

If *N=1*  we will consider a consensus to have been reached.  If *N > 1*, *and* if all of the explanations are qualitatively the same, i.e. involving the same essential physics and objects (e.g. ""Comet breakup""), we will also consider consensus to have been reached.  Otherwise, we will consider that consensus has not yet been reached.

A little over 500 years later, on June 25, 2522, there is [predicted to be] a nice long (longest of that century) solar eclipse that will pass over Africa.  

In terms of astronomy, the 2522 eclipse prediction is nearly as secure at the 2017 one:  the [primary uncertainty] is the exact timing of the eclipse, and stems from uncertainties in the rate of change of Earth's rotation -- but this uncertainty should be of order minutes only.

However, 500 years is a long time for a technological civilization, and if ours survives on this timescale, it could engineer the solar system in various ways and potentially invalidate the assumptions of this prediction.  With that in mind:

**Will there be a total solar eclipse on June 25, 2522?**

For the question to resolve positively, the calendar system used in evaluating the resolution must match the Gregorian calendar system used in the eclipse predictions; the eclipse must be of Sol by a Moon with at least 95% of its original structure by volume unaltered, and must be observable from Earth's surface, with  ""Earth"" defined by our current Earth with at least 95% of its original structure by volume altered only by natural processes.

/questions/122/can-quantum-gravity-be-interestingly-constrained-using-tabletop-experiments/,Can quantum gravity be interestingly constrained using tabletop experiments?,forecast,122,0.0,,RESOLVED,0.32,"Modern theories of quantum gravity are generally thought to only be testable at the [Planck scale] - very high energies or very small distances beyond our current technological scope. However, in the past five years proposals have been made for tabletop experiments for quantum gravity. These experiments won't need to access Planck scale physics; rather, they could use recently successful laboratory techniques ([1], [2]) for manipulating macroscopic quantum systems, and attempt to observe quantum gravity phenomona in these systems.

Italian group [Belenchia *et al*] propose using opto-mechanical quantum oscillators to measure a specific predicted effect of quantum gravity. [Opto-mechanical oscillators] are macroscopic objects, like highly reflective silicone mirrors on springs, whose motions can be controlled by pulses of electromagnetic radiation. Belenchia *et al* explain that the specific effect to look for is a periodic [*squeezing*], or localization of the oscillating component's position; the overall motion will no longer be simple harmonic oscillation, due to corrections from gravitational effects. Another paper by Australian group [Gan *et al*] also outlines the feasibility of testing quantum gravity in an opto-mechanical setting. 

The design of these flavor of experiments is within technical scope, as claimed by the papers, albeit challenging. The opto-mechanical system must be supercooled into a highly quantum mechanical state and extremely precise measurements of the oscillator must be made. More importantly, the underlying concept's validity still needs to be explored through the peer review process. 

**Can opto-mechanical systems of the proposed type interestingly constrain quantum gravity models?**

This question will resolve positively if the following are satisfied:

(a) either the Belanchia or Gan paper receives 10 or more citations on Google Scholar by the end of 2016

(b) an experimental physics paper is published by January 1, 2018 which cites either of the above articles and mentions opto-mechanics to study quantum gravity in the abstract.

The [World Health Organization] (WHO) is being pushed by many drug developers to classify aging as a disease, which would allow pharmaceuticals to produce commercialized medication that specifically targets the process, and in turn treating all the pathology, of aging. 

A change like this would take place in the final release of [ICD-11] (International Classification of Diseases, 11th revision), which will be released by WHO by 2018. The change in classification would have an imact in aging research and drugs that are currently in trial or under review, allowing for a non-ambiguous approach to treating aging itself as a condition. For example, the drug [Metformin], whose marketed intent is to treat type II diabetes but shown to increase longevity in [animal studies], would gain traction with the FDA to officially classify it as an aging treatment. 

***Will WHO recognize ageing as a disease in ICD-11? ***

* The black holes involved in the merger [were heavier than expected to be seen], likely requiring the adjustment of stellar evolution models.

* The event was observed almost as soon as the machine was turned on. This, combined with the fact that another significant trigger event was also seen in the first few days of data (LVT151012), though not yet confirmed to be genuine, [suggests a rate of mergers] at the high end of what was considered possible. 

* A gamma ray burst counterpart candidate [was unexpectedly observed] by Fermi GBM 0.4s after the merger.

* There is a published paper or preprint by the LIGO scientific collaboration, VIRGO scientific collaboration or other relevant gravitational wave experiments, possibly in coordination with electromagnetic and neutrino observatories, announcing the observation of a gravitational wave event.

* The gravitational wave event is observed with high statistical significance in multiple detectors (>4 sigma equivalent combined significance) and does not correlate with any known background or possible noise source. This observation is possibly accompanied by a high statistical significance detection of an electromagnetic or neutrino counterpart.

So called dark matter ""hairs,"" these would constitute a new prediction of the Big Bang [standard model of cosmology], \(\Lambda\)CDM. Dark matter [halos] are known to collect themselves into cosmic scale filaments, but if the dark matter is sufficiently cold, smaller filaments can also exist on scales comparable to our solar system. Prezéau predicts that if one of these fine-grain streams passes through a planet, gravity squeezes the streams into dense regions ([hairs]), which exhibit points of critical density ([roots]) at specified distances away from the center of the planet in question. 

In the case of Earth, these roots would be located around \(10^6\) km away from the planetary center, a bit more than twice the distance to the Moon. They would be high-density hot spots for us to look for dark matter particles.

Prediction markets have offered an alternative to poll aggregation in forecasting elections.  Markets such as (the now defunct) InTrade, the [Iowa Electronic Markets](http://tippie.uiowa.edu/iem/), [PredictIt](https://www.predictit.org/), and others ask users to buy and sell shares assigned to each candidate in each race, so that the price point corresponds to the probability of victory.  In this question we focus on PredictIt, which allows users to place relatively small real-money bets on candidates.

Both [fivethirtyeight.com](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/south-carolina-democratic/) and [PredictIt](https://www.predictit.org/Browse/Group/64/Super-Tuesday) have published probabilities for each of the 11 Super Tuesday Primaries on both the Republican and Democratic side.  

*Which forecasts will prove to be more accurate?*

To compare, we will score each set of predictions using a [Brier score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score) averaged over all \(N=22\) races, computed as
\[S = {1\over N}\sum_{i=1,N} \sum_{j=1,M_i} (p_{ij}-o_{ij})^2,\]
where *j* enumerates the \(M_i\) possible outcomes (i.e. possible winners) in the *i*th race out of *N*, where \(p_{ij}\) is the forecast probability of candidate *j* winning the *i*th race, and \(o_{ij}\) is assigned 1 if candidate *j* wins the *i*th race, and 0 otherwise.

For example, PredictIt assigns (as of writing) 52% to Clinton and 48% to Sanders in the Minnesota Democratic Primary.  If this were the only primary, and Clinton won, PredictIt would achieve a Brier Score of 
\[S=(0.52-1)^2+(0.48-0)^2 = 0.4608.\]
A lower Brier score is better, with perfect predictions corresponding to \(S=0\). (In the case where PredictIt's prices do not add up to $1, we will normalize them to $1 to convert to probabilities.)

This question resolves positively if the Brier score for the 22 races is lower for PredictIt's probabilities than for fivethirtyeight.com's probabilities, where we will take values as of noon EST on 2/29/2016, and election outcomes as reported on 3/1-3/2.",,False,,politics--us,True,,,,,True,

The question of whether the world will end is a perennial one, with The End sometimes forecast to come within a human lifetime or two.  This is an ultra-important question, but not the biggest possible one: we can widen our question to whether ""The Universe"" will end.  

Even posing this question is not very straightforward, as ""The Universe"" has come to mean a great variety of things, from the *observable* universe that we see through telescopes, all the way through various types of [multiverses](http://www.britannica.com/science/multiverse).  So let's start with some definitions.

When we view a particular epoch of the universe through electromagnetic (and now gravitational!) radiation, we are seeing a two-dimensional sphere that we can think of as the ""sky"" at some ""distance.""  Assembling these nested spheres back to around the [nucleosynthesis era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang_nucleosynthesis) era gives a ball of about [46.5 billion light years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe) in radius.  This [""observiball""](http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-19373118) can also be thought of as a past [""lightcone,""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_cone) and  this lightcone and its interior constitute a [3+1 dimensional spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime) region containing every post-nucleosynthesis event that occurred to our past from which information can have reached us traveling at the speed of light or less.

Turning this around to look into the future, we can consider the ""Affectiball,"" or future lightcone, which bounds the region of spacetime that we, here and now on Earth, could reach with sub-lightspeed travel or signaling.  Assuming that no future technology allows faster-than-light information transfer (or at least does so only within regions of spacetime [pre-engineered](http://www.physics.uofl.edu/wkomp/teaching/spring2006/589/final/wormholes.pdf) for this purposed), everything humanity will ever do or cause will sit within this Affectiball.

We can now ask whether this *Affectiball* (and its interior) goes on forever, or ends.  This really contains two questions.  First, will the *spacetime* go on forever, or terminate in a singularity like the [big crunch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Crunch)?  Second, will interesting things continue to happen forever, or will the Affectiball approach some sort of equilibrium [""heat death""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe)?  If we assert that ""interesting things"" require the ability to do computations, and that computations can't happen without spacetime (see [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0110141) and [here](http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0404510)
 for some discussion), we can combine these into one question:

**Is the number of computations that can in principle be done within the Affectiball finite?**

If so, we can say the universe will end, at least in terms of anything we can affect or take part in.

Most of the aforementioned spacecraft observe solar wind and the Sun's surface, while the Van Allen probes watch for radiation and magnetic storms; DSCOVR is the only satellite to provide early detection of coronal mass ejections. 

Plans to find a long-term replacement for DSCOVR at the L1 Lagrange point do exist as part of the [National Space Weather Program]'s mission over the next decade. Beyond just finding replacements, the [recommendations of policymakers] (like [this whisper] coming out of this year's AAAS meeting) push for more observation spacecraft which can collect forecast data in assessment of risks from space weather.  The [space weather plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/final_nationalspaceweatheractionplan_20151028.pdf) contains the action item (5.3.2) to be completed by October 2016:

> NASA and DOC will assess space-weather-observation platforms with deep-space orbital positions (including candidate propulsion technology), which allow for additional warning time of incoming space-weather events.

***By June 2017, will a US or NASA budget appropriation exist (making reference to the October 2015 report) for the (perhaps initial) design and/or development of a spacecraft whose chief mission is to provide early warning of space weather events?***

Turnout is often low, and the terms ""butterfly ballot"" and ""hanging chad"" still linger in our collective consciousness following the uncertainty of the 2000 presidential election. 

Since we are already able to do practically everything else via the internet –bank, shop, communicate, etc., – online voting seems like a natural next step. Some argue that online voting would increase turnout and bring voting access to anyone with the internet, without the need to go to a polling place on Election Day. 

Currently, [22 states](http://www.businessinsider.com/22-states-that-allow-you-to-vote-online-2016-9) allow for some form of online voting, allowing members of the military and other citizens living overseas to return their ballots by email.

In March 2016 the Utah Republican Party [offered online voting](https://www.wired.com/2016/03/security-experts-arent-going-like-utahs-online-primary/) to all registered voters in its presidential caucus. 

The major problem that hampers [every proposal](https://www.verifiedvoting.org/resources/internet-voting/) for online voting is security. Repeated analyses find that, given the impossibility of sufficiently protecting the millions of personal devices that would be used in an online election, the risk of malicious interference in the election is too high to recommend proceeding with online voting.

Backović shows that a simple two parameter model accurately fits the evolution of the cumulative number of preprints on a topic for nine episodes of ambulance chasing in recent history. The model is then used to forecast the total number of preprints that will be written about the recent 750 GeV diphoton excess seen at the Large Hadron Collider. There is a recent [Metaculus question about this topic](http://www.metaculus.com/questions/41/), asking whether the statistical significance of the excess will increase by the ICHEP conference.

This world, now known as ""Planet Nine"", is predicted to have a mass roughly ten times that of Earth, an orbital period of about 20,000 years, and a large eccentricity (e~0.6).

[Batygin and Brown's paper] (which, by 3/17, had been downloaded a staggering 307,188 times) presents indirect dynamical evidence for Planet Nine. Its presence is inferred through the gravitational sculpting that it has produced in the trajectories of small Pluto-like worlds that lie beyond Neptune's orbit.

A recent paper by [Fienga et al.] adds credibility and detail to the Planet Nine hypothesis. The authors examine how Planet Nine affects the orbit of Saturn, whose orbital trajectory can be measured to great accuracy using ranging data from NASA's Cassini spacecraft. Inclusion of Planet Nine in the ultra-precise INPOP Solar System ephemerides reduces the error in Cassini's position relative to the model if Planet Nine's true anomaly is of order 118 degrees.

Based on the [Fienga et al.] result, Metaculus calculates a most probable current sky position for Planet Nine of RA=2h, Dec=-20 deg, in the constellation Cetus. This area of the sky becomes visible to ground-based wide-field cameras in mid-Summer. At the most probable location, the planet's current distance would be r=620 AU, and the expected V magnitude is 21. An update to our original [Planet Nine question] is thus definitely in order:

Will the discovery by direct observation of a new solar system planet having characteristics substantially similar to those described in the Batygin-Brown paper, and at a sky position within 20 degrees of the Fienga et al. best-fit location be announced in a peer-reviewed paper prior to Dec. 31, 2016?

(For this question to resolve as ""Yes"", the new planet should have an inferred radius larger than that of Earth, an orbital period greater than 5,000 years, and an orbital eccentricity e > 0.25).

InSight, and the [InSight Mars lander], is the 12th standalone Discovery Program mission managed at NASA JPL. It's purpose: investigate the seismic activity of Mars by drilling to position a seismomitor a few meters under the martian surface. 

The InSight probe would have been mission-ready this March if not for mechanical failures on the craft and budget constraints. The failure was a [leak] in the vacuum chamber that contains the seismometer's sensors, discovered last December, and costing at least $150M to fix and exceeding the overall budget of $625M.

Even with the budget constraints, NASA announced on March 9, 2016 that the repairs would be carried out and the launch would be [rescheduled for May of 2018]. Given that there was a failure during the course of development of this craft, and the [success history] of Mars missions is known, what can be said about the likelihood of success for the InSight probe?

Note that the probe must be mission-ready by May, otherwise it will miss the critical [launch window] when Mars and Earth are closest in their orbits, and the mission will have to wait another 26 months.

In May 2013, the median home price in London [topped 600,000 GBP](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/may/11/average-london-home-doubles-price-house-property), around double the median price in 2009, during the Great Recession. Afraid of a bubble bursting, particularly among the priciest homes, the Bank of Ireland in March stated that it [would not give loans](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/03/17/bank-of-ireland-fears-londons-housing-market-is-overheating/) greater than 500,000 GBP to protect itself from possible losses in a market correction. 

To support prices that are well out of range for average Londoners, the British government amended its Help to Buy program, which [allows prospective homeowners to borrow up to 20% of the cost of the home](http://www.theweek.co.uk/house-prices/55455/help-to-buy-how-it-works-and-who-should-apply) from the government before seeking a mortgage for the rest. In London, the government borrowing limit is up to 40% of the home's value, and is capped at 600,000 GBP.

Part of this program is a detailed reporting system of the [theft, loss, or accidental release of  select agents](http://www.selectagents.gov/form3.html).  

A summary of the reports under this system from 2004-2010 by [Henkel et al.](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.281.7793&rep=rep1&type=pdf) found eleven laboratory-acquired infections (LAIs) during this period (along with 639 accidental ""releases""), but none leading to human fatality.  The report showed steadily and quickly increasing (> 29%/year) report numbers from 2004-2010, suggesting increasing reporting rates. (It is also likely that the number of labs working with select agents increased, and in-principle possible that the accident rate increased, but these seem unlikely to explain such a rapid rise.)  This leaves open to question how many accidents (and LAIs) go unreported.

A 2006 literature review by [Harding and Byers](http://www.asmscience.org/content/book/10.1128/9781555815899.ch04) found a large number of LAIs, with [updated statistics](http://www.absaconference.org/pdf56/II930Byers.pdf) of 2033 LAIs and 37 deaths (with 13 deaths since 2005).  These numbers are difficult to compare, as LAIs can occur without an identified accident leading to them.

As of March 20, 2016, [according to CDC numbers](http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/2014-west-africa/case-counts.html), the outbreak caused 28608 cases and 11305 fatalities.   The outbreak is now largely contained thanks to a belated but significant international effort, including ~$5.3B in funding allocated by the US.

As of writing, there is a [standoff in congress](http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/congress-goes-home-easter-break-without-paying-zika-fight-n544526) between the Obama Administration and Congress over where funding to address the current Zika outbreak should come from.  The administration has requested approx. $1.9B US; congress has so far left this request unfunded, requiring instead that the Administration spend money remaining from the emergency Ebola funding instead of appropriating additional money to address Zika.

Approx. $2.5B in Ebola funding remains unspent (out of $5.3B allocated during the epidemic). However, the current plan for that funding is to spend it on preparedness infrastructure in developing countries so that they can better prevent, detect, or respond to outbreaks in the future.

Future outbreaks of Ebola -- among other diseases -- are inevitable (the CDC site lists 13 Ebola outbreaks since 2000); the question is how large they will become, which depends largely on the infrastructure in-place and the ability for local and global fast response to the outbreak.

/questions/196/a-medical-pathway-to-complete-painlessness/,A medical pathway to complete painlessness?,forecast,196,0.0,,RESOLVED,0.05,"The scientific community has--for over a decade--recognized that the [voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.7 protein], which is found in neurons among nearly every type of human tissue, is primarily responsible for pain sensing in mammals. Small-molecule inhibitors of this channel, however, fail to completely shut off the pain response in humans. Mysteriously, a [non-functional mutant] of this protein homologue in mice has been shown to achieve painlessness. Since then, a number of drugs with marginal success have been developed by multinational healthcare companies, including [Roche] and [Biogen].

A recent study has revealed [a novel function of Nav1.7] that may present a possible new target for drug therapies against chronic pain.  According to scientists from the lab of Dr. John Wood at University College London, deletion or deleterious mutation of the Nav1.7 gene in mice caused the expression of opiate-simulating proteins (""opioids"") to be up-regulated--a contribution to their painlessness not observed in humans. A Nav1.7-lacking, pain-insensitive human subject, after being given opioid blockers, was able to feel pain for the first time.  A combined treatment with opioids in addition to Nav1.7 blockers in mice proved to have the expected opposite effect: a complete suppression of the pain response.

The newly-discovered treatment apparently works, but still [remains somewhat impractical]. While relatively small, biologics like opiods are fairly difficult (and therefore expensive) to produce, store, distribute, etc. Other options would be geneitc modification or, more commonly, a small-molecule substitute--specifically, one that will inhibit the opiod-regulating function of Nav1.7, either directly or indirectly. Regardless of treatment options, the discovery has the potential to significantly change the way we approach pain management. 

***By 2020, will a US clinical trial begin in which the goal is a temporary or permanent complete inhibition of the pain response in a human?***

For a positive resolution, there must exist by Jan 1, 2020 a clinical trial in the [US database](https://clinicaltrials.gov) with a start date prior to Jan 1, 2020, which aims to use the Nav1.7 channel to completely suppress the human pain response in part or all of the body.

Its presence is manifested gravitationally, however, as it is required to explain the dynamics of galaxies, clusters, and cosmic large-scale structures, affects the microwave background anisotropies, and can even be mapped  using gravitational lensing. 

Several candidate particles responsible for dark matter have been proposed, but the current front-runners are [Weakly] Interacting Massive Particles ([WIMPs]). This attractiveness stems largely from the fact that [SUSY] naturally predicts the existence of a supersymmetric WIMP with kinematic and cosmological constraints consistent with dark matter. 

Since WIMPs interact with ordinary matter via the electroweak interaction, they can in principle be detected directly in [scattering events with atomic nuclei], among [other methods]. However, experiments to detect them have only given null results so far. 

A major ongoing test for WIMP-nucleon scattering is [Xenon1T] in Italy, with a much higher sensitivity than [preceding experiments]; this dark matter detector is essentially a 3500 kilogram target of liquid Xenon sandwiched between two arrays of photomultiplier tubes. The arrays will detect signals from scintillation and electron drift generated from particles scattering off Xenon nuclei, at which point known [backgrounds] will be subtracted out to get the WIMP signal.  Xenon1T is expected to start collecting data in spring 2016.

[Failure to see supersymmetry at the LHC](http://www.metaculus.com/questions/17/) so far, with no sign of WIMPs in direct-detection so far has raised the question as to whether WIMPs deserve their dark matter frontrunner status.  But perhaps they will be vindicated soon?

With the nearest stars parsecs away, reaching them in a human lifetime requires speeds of at least 10% the speed of light.  As can be seen from the [rocket equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation), chemical rockets with exhaust speeds of a few km/s would require exponentially large mass to attain relativistic speeds of ~100,000 km/s.  It's hopeless.

Unless relativistic exhaust speeds can be obtained (difficult!), leaving the solar system will require *external* acceleration.  A variety of schemes along these lines have been proposed over the years.  

For example, the [""starwisp""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starwisp) is a small nanowire mesh ""sail"" driven by the radiation pressure of reflected microwaves; the microwaves would be produced by a phased array of terrestrial or orbital dishes.  

Recently, a detailed study of laser-driven sails [was posted](http://www.deepspace.ucsb.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/A-Roadmap-to-Interstellar-Flight-15-h.pdf) proposing use of newly-developed ultra-high-reflectivity materials, and (now technically feasible) phased arrays of optical/IR lasers.  High reflectivity allows acceleration without incineration; phased arrays allow a highly collimated beam without a laser of enormous diameter.

While technically plausible, such systems would require large-scale investment in both R&D and deployment on the scale of at least a major NASA mission or large-scale particle physics project.  

The possibility of this occurring just received a major boost with the announcement that entrepreneur and Philanthropist [Yuri Milner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Milner) has [committed $100 Million](http://breakthroughinitiatives.org) to a ""research and engineering program [that] will seek proof of concept for using light beam to propel gram-scale ‘nanocraft’ to 20% light speed.""

A reasonable first step in this plan is to test a 10 kW phased laser array to test beam targeting and stability.

1) An accelerating system comprised of:

- A kilometer-scale Earthbound phased array of lasers

- Facility to store and discharge Gigawatts of energy to drive the beam

- A conventional rocket system that would deliver many ""nanocrafts"" to high-altitude orbit

- Using adaptive optics to compensate for atmospheric distortions in the beam array

2) A design for ultra-light miniaturized probes with:

-  Super-reflective coating and high surface/mass ratio.

- Ability to withstand collisions with interplanetary and interstellar dust grains

- Ability to capture and store images and other scientific data

- Ability to transmit data back to Earth from great distances using an onboard laser

While this plan has a lot of thinking behind it, many plans change when confronted with experimental reality.  Here we ask for an assessment of the probability that a major component of this plan will change.  Such changes could include, for example,

- Using a space-based laser (or other) system

- Using a millimeter wave or microwave system rather than optical/IR system

- Relatively larger spacecraft (e.g. meter-scale or above)

SETI's [Allen Telescope Array](http://www.seti.org/ata) (ATA), in the mountains of Northern California, is an array of 42 antennas that, together, can achieve the astronomical observing power of much larger antenna dishes. Since its completion in 2007, the ATA has been listening to the skies for clear, repeating radio signals at frequencies that might indicate broadcasts by an intelligent civilization. From 2009-2015, the ATA focused on known extrasolar planets, but [found no signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04207) that met the criteria for alien life.

Red dwarf stars had [previously been dismissed](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2082988-seti-looks-at-red-dwarf-stars-in-its-search-for-ancient-aliens/) as SETI targets because their chances for hosting habitable planets were thought to be dim. But red dwarves are abundant in the galaxy, and some are closer to the earth than more sun-like stars, meaning that signals from close red dwarves (such as [Proxima Centauri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxima_Centauri), the nearest star to our Sun) would be stronger and clearer. As many as one-half of red dwarves may hold planets in the so-called ""habitable zone."" Research into such possible planets (which would likely be locked with one side facing the star at all times and the other side in eternal night) suggest that oceans and atmospheres could move enough heat around to allow life to develop and thrive. Another plus: red dwarves are old stars, allowing life more time to develop intelligence and technology. 

By focusing on a certain star type, astronomers will gather a large dataset on red dwarves, possibly uncovering new insights about the star type that will be useful to astronomers, even if a signal of alien life is not found.

The stated claim is:

It is unclear whether this database has actually been used in patent evaluation at this time.

Although most of the published inventions are (readable) nonsense, it is quite possible that some of them describe (perhaps with some interpretation) actual workable inventions, and that with better algorithms some of those inventions might even become interesting or make up a higher proportion of the total.  As the site says:

> It is not unforeseeable with current technology (along with sufficient cash for fees) to flood the actual patent 
> application process itself with sufficiently advanced patent applications based on this concept.

It is also easy to imagine (though possibly challenging to implement) a system that ensures novelty by comparing against both the US patent database and the Prior Art database.  One can also envisage a ""competitor"" system that generates patents more effectively than Prior Art, runs them against the Prior Art database to ensure that they are novel, and files them for patenting.

This organism has passed regulatory approval in [several countries in central and South America]( http://www.oxitec.com/first-phase-of-oxitecs-brazil-trial-successfully-completed/), and has since shown significant efficacy in attenuating the population within targeted regions.

A [previous question](http://www.metaculus.com/questions/190/) concerns whether the FDA will approve expanded use of Oxitec mosquitos for Aedes aegypti population control in the US.  The US region most likely to be highly impacted by Zika first is Puerto Rico.  Therefore we ask: 

**Will mosquitos engineered to reduce the Aedes aegypti population be released in Puerto Rico by January 2017?**

For positive resolution, the release must be part of an official program, but need not necessarily be Oxitec's mosquitos (though that seems most likely), and be reported by a reliable media or official sources.

Note that this is probably contingent on a positive outcome of the [previous question on GMO mosquito regulation](http://www.metaculus.com/questions/190/), (since the FDA's jurisdiction [includes Puerto Rico](http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/Transparency/Basics/ucm194877.htm)),  but this is not an formal requirement for positive resolution.",,False,,bio--bioengineering;bio--genetics;bio--infectious-disease;bio--medicine;tech--biotech,True,,,,True,,

This question concerns how quickly Zika will spread and grow during the next 1.5 years, and focuses on the US where reporting and projections by the CDC can be assumed to be relatively accurate.

Fundamental laws of physics such as Quantum Field Theory and General Relativity can be consistently posed in any number of spatial dimensions (though more than one time dimension is generally problematic), and mathematically N dimensions are just about as easy to described as 3.

Relatively few compelling explanations have been put forth to explain this question.  One explanation is the ""anthropic"" one: too few dimensions life is very difficult (e.g. a 2D lifeform can't have a digestive tract without bifurcating!), and in 4+ dimensions orbits and traditional atoms are unstable. (See [Max Tegmark's paper](http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/dimensions.pdf) for some details.)

Two key landmark successes came together in 2016 that have sparked great enthusiasm for the potential of the eLISA proposal; first, LIGO published in February the first detection of Einstein-gravity waves, and secondly, the LISA pathfinder probe, designed to test the technical challenges of the eLISA mission, found eLISA to be [feasible]. The [advisory panel] even encouraged the possibility of an earlier launch date, which would move the launch from the mid 2030s to 2029. 

The following is a synopsis of the mission design - for more depth, see the [whitepaper]. Three satellites forming the vertices of an equilateral triangle (side length 1 million km!) will be launched into a heliocentric orbit, trailing the Earth by 20°. Like LIGO, eLISA is based on a Michelson interferometer design; two spacecrafts make up the endpoints of the interferometer arms and send and receive laser light to a source craft, which then measures the changing arm length through phase differences in the light. However, the core variable eLISA is measuring is the changing non-geodesic acceleration between a pair of test masses housed in free-fall in the source spacecraft. Combined with interferometric measurements on additional test masses housed in each arm, a signal and noise spectrum can be established on the contracting and expanding spacetime between the masses due to gravitational waves. eLISA can measure the frequency, phase, and polarity information of the incoming waves to identify high-magnitude gravitational events, such as inspiraling black hole binaries.

Formerly [LISA], eLISA was intended to be a joint endeavor between NASA and ESA. In 2011, a lack of funding led to [NASA removing itself] from the efforts of the mission. The mission development is currently led by ESA with limited participation by NASA, but resource constraints on ESA's part may create a compelling need for more U.S. - European collaboration. Currently ESA permits a maximum of 20% contribution from NASA; will this change?

> Since 1500, there appear to have been 13 or more influenza pandemics[....]; in the past 120 years there were undoubted pandemics in 1889, 1918, 1957, 1968 and 1977. In 1918, the worst pandemic in recorded history caused approximately 546,000 excess deaths in the United States (675,000 total deaths) and killed up to 50 million people worldwide.

[Previous survey](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/docs/fischhoff/AF-GPH.pdf) indicate that experts assign significant probability to such pandemics recurring.  For our first question we focus on this possibility:

** Will the CDC, WHO, or a published scientific paper report that H5N1 or a similar influenza virus has become an efficient human-to-human transmitter (capable of being propagated through at least two epidemiological generations of affected humans) by mid-2019? **

(*Notes:* Here, ""similar"" will be taken to mean an H5N1 strain, or a strain described in the literature as a ""variant"", ""version"", etc., of the current H5N1, and in particular be believed to have a similar fatality rate.

[General Fusion], based in British Columbia, is a privately funded company pursuing [magnetized target fusion] (MTF), backed by venture capital funds [as well as individual backers] including Jeff Bezos (Amazon), Paul Allen (Microsoft) and Peter Thiel (PayPal). 

MTF works by heating a gaseous fusion fuel into a plasma, coercing it into magnetic confinement, and then uniformly compressing the plasma until it reaches fusion-capable densities and temperatures. In General Fusion's case, an array of pneumatic impact pistons in a ""[Spheromak]"" design serve as acoustic drivers for the compression stage, delivering a high impulse but requires extreme timing precision. 

General Fusion is currently in the midst of the testing and development phase of the individual subsystems for their prototype MTF reactor, and the next goal is to build a full scale device to achieve net-gain fusion. However, they currently face a great challenge in keeping the plasma thermally well insulated in order to meet design temperatures before compression.

General Fusion's reactor [design] specifies plasma temperatures of T = 10 \({KeV}/{k_b}\) (over 100 million Kelvin) after 10:1 radial compression. A milestone before this is the 4:1 compression stage in [subsystem testing], at which they have been able to heat the plasma to 200 \({eV}/{k_b}\) but hope to exceed temperatures of 600 \({eV}/{k_b}\).

As discussed in [this question](http://www.metaculus.com/questions/256), researchers have successfully ""upgraded"" [H5N1 to be airborne](http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/31876/title/Deliberating-Over-Danger/), using techniques that could also be applied to MERS and SARs — all pathogens with high virulence but low transmissibility.  One could also imagine increasing the virulence of highly-transmissible flus or other illnesses.  Techniques used by these groups have been published and are thus available to other researchers with sufficient expertise.

Bioweapons research on large scales is outlawed by the [Bioweapons Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_Weapons_Convention), but this did not prevent the Soviets from following a massive program into the 1980s and perhaps 1990s, and it is quite possible that clandestine programs exist today using more modern techniques.

Genetic engineering also opens up possibilities that do not exist in nature or earlier research efforts. For example, pathogens could be engineered to attack people with genetic markers strongly correlated with particular races or types of ancestry (as so-called ""[ethnic bioweapon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_bioweapon)"").

This ""gain of function"" (GoF) research may help prepare use for naturally-occuring variants of these diseases and enhance our ability to generate better vaccines, etc. However, there are obvious potential dangers as well: an accidental release, or deliberate theft of such organisms could create a potential pandemic; even the information published about such efforts could increase the probability of bioterror or bioerror events.

In October 2014, the White House [issued a funding pause] on such experiments involving influenza and coronaviruses, partly in response to a statement by the [Cambridge Working Group] that called for a curtailment of experiments to create potential pandemic pathogens in the laboratory, pending a risk and benefit assessment. The White House charged the National Science Advisory Board on Biosecurity (NSABB) with commissioning such a report. 

After the completion of this report and several high-level meetings, the NSABB composed a set of recommendations; see the [draft report here](http://osp.od.nih.gov/sites/default/files/NSABB_Working_Group_Draft_Report.pdf). 

 These recommendations do not call for a moratorium on the funding of any particular types of research, but for various levels of additional oversight in the funding of ""gain of function research of concern,"" (GoFRoC) which they define as a subset of GoF research that is 

- highly transmissible and likely capable of wide and uncontrollable spread in human populations; *and* 
- highly virulent and likely to cause significant morbidity and/or mortality in humans.

The report calls for ""additional, multidisciplinary review, prior to determining whether they are acceptable for funding. If funded, such projects should be subject to ongoing oversight at the Federal and institutional levels"" and calls for ""An external advisory body that is designed for transparency and public engagement should be utilized as part of the U.S. government’s ongoing evaluation of oversight policies for GOF research of concern.""

Many elements of this whole issue (and see [here](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/05/us-advisers-sign-plan-reviewing-risky-virus-studies) for a good summary) could form the basis of questions.  Here we focus on the bottom line:

** By the end of 2018 will US federal funding go to 2 or more research projects performing GOF research of concern? **

Resolution is positive if two of more distinct federal grants have been fully approved that fund GoFRoC research, i.e. have been identified in review as this type of research, received (we can hope) additional levels of scrutiny, and received approval.  This may be identified by media report, by presence in an accessible research grant database, or other credible source.

Nonetheless, some research and research publication have encountered criticism for potentially *increasing* the risk of accidental pandemic, or deliberate bioweapon attack.  In a prominent example, in 2012 a Dutch research group published a description of a lab-modified strain of H5N1 influenza virus capable of airborne transmission between ferrets.

Consensus on ""leave"" was that there was a 32% chance. The Brexit, however, really caught the global financial markets by surprise. In the days prior to the vote, stock prices across the world were generally on the increase, with the S&P 500 peaking at 2112.93 at the close of the US Market on June 23rd, not far from its all-time high. And as measured by closing options prices on the index, demand for insurance against loss while the vote was well under way was not particularly high.

A few hours later, however, as it became clear that ""Leave"" would prevail, futures contracts on the S&P 500 went into free fall. At one point, in the midst of heavy overnight trading at the CME, they plunged nearly 6%. Market losses the next day were very heavy across the board. More than 2 trillion dollars in global stock market value evaporated. Viewed another way, each of the 17,410,742 ""leave"" votes generated a $115,000 loss in global market capitalization, a value that is nearly three times larger than the British per-capita GDP.

As usual, the market losses were accompanied by steep increases in volatility. The VIX index spiked to a high of 26.24, closing up 49.33% in a single trading session.

Impressive as that jump may sound, the forthcoming market disruptions implied by VIX are actually relatively modest. During the throes of the Financial Crisis in October 2008, a peak VIX print of 89.53 was observed. Roughly speaking, the value of the VIX index amounts to the expected one-sigma change in the S&P 500 index price during the coming year.

A look at the [time series for the VIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIX) shows that volatility tends to spike abruptly, and then decay in a roughly exponential manner over a period of months until the next shock hits.

The El Niño conditions ended in May, and a band of cool ocean water is now developing in the central and east-central Pacific. This phenomenon is associated with the *La Niña* flipside of the Southern Oscillation. Empirically, La Niña tends to be associated with dry winters for California, but the connection is by no means one to one.

The announcement in the news media of the detection of an alien-generated signal, or some other strong evidence of an extraterrestrial civilization, would clearly generate quite a bit of interest.

This is, however, not quite the end of the story.  The referendum was, technically, non-binding, and many things must happen in order to actually enact withdrawal from the EU.  Most centrally, perhaps, is that per Article 50 of the EU treaty, the nation wishing to exit provides a notification to the EU, negotiates the withdrawal terms and sets a date of of when the treaty terms no longer apply. See [this description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal_from_the_European_Union) in Wikipedia.

In this question we give Metaculus predictors a chance to win back some of their hard (for the most part) lost points on brexit by asking if the UK will *actually* exit in the next several years.

We'll set the bar slightly lower by setting the resolution criterion to be that the UK has, by end of 2016, officially filed notice with the EU per Article 50 of its intention to withdraw.  If this question resolves positively, we can launch another one regarding the negotiations and timescales.

Transits are scientifically valuable because they enable direct measurements of planetary densities, and they impart clues about bulk and atmospheric compositions.

[By the Post's accounting,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/police-shootings/) 990 people were fatally shot in police encounters in the United States in 2015. Further statistics paint a picture of the majority of encounters: Most of the victims were white males, armed with a deadly weapon in the process of an active attack. By race, 26% of those shot and killed were black and 17% were Hispanic. Mental illness played a factor in at least 25% of incidents.

Part I,forecast,278,1.1410906738559412e-283,,RESOLVED,0.15,"The question of whether our perceived reality is ""really real"" as opposed to a dream, hallucination, fabrication or (in modern times) *simulation* is an ancient and vexing one.  

Virtual Reality and Artificial Intelligence, dramatically extrapolated, suggest paths by which we might be denizens of a simulated world.  

In what we might call ""natural consciousness, virtual reality"" (NCVR), a (presumably) biologically based consciousness would be fooled, via its sensory inputs, into believing it exists in a very different reality than its physical body.  This is the conceit behind, for example, [The Matrix](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/) movie series and the ""[brain in a vat](http://www.iep.utm.edu/brainvat/)"" set of philosophical explorations.

A different mode, ""artificial consciousness, simulated reality"" (ACSR) considers artificially intelligent and conscious computer programs that experience a fully fabricated reality – what might be true (under certain philosophical assumptions) if a non-playing character in a video game were sufficiently complex as to have an internal subjective experience. (This would also describe the ""Agents"" in The Matrix.)

While this is (literally!) the stuff of science fiction, there are cogent arguments put forth in the literature, for example [by Bostrom](http://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.html), that we are *likely* to be in a simulated reality.  In a nutshell, if such simulations are possible, it is likely that somewhere in spacetime they will be performed, and arguably give rise to many, many more simulated beings than does the ""real world.""  Thus if we assume just that we are subjectively self-aware beings, we are more likely to be one of the simulated ones than a ""real"" one.

This argument has recently been in the news when [Elon Musk asserted](http://arstechnica.co.uk/the-multiverse/2016/06/are-we-living-in-a-simulated-reality-elon-musk/) that “There’s a one in billions chance [we’re in] base reality... I think it’s one in billions.""  

While primarily a topic of late-night conversations after a few drinks, it does not seem impossible for this to be the subject of some rigorous research, and careful investigation might well lead to interesting insights into, for example, theories of consciousness, artificial intelligence, the interpretations of quantum mechanics, the anthropic principle, etc.  On the other hand, investigating a problem at the intersection of four inscrutable and intractable problems may just be the road to madness. Which will it be?


We'll ask:

** By June 1, 2018, will a published paper appear in either Physical Review D, JHEP, JCAP, or Nature discussing (as a central topic of the paper) potentially observable signatures that we exist in a simulated reality.**

The paper could concern either NCSR or RCVR modes.  A cursory side-note does not count, nor does a purely theoretical discussion of any length: there must be a discussion of what we might in principle do to observationally/experimentally distinguish some mode of ACSR or RCVR simulation from ""physical reality"" as generally construed.

/questions/280/are-we-in-a-simulated-reality-part-ii/,Are we in a simulated reality? Part II,forecast,280,0.0,,CLOSED,0.15,"In [Part I](http://www.metaculus.com/questions/278/are-we-in-a-simulated-reality-part-i/), we discussed two (of perhaps more) potential ""modes"" in which we might inhabit a simulated reality: NCVR (Natural Consciousness, Virtual Reality) and ACSR (Artificial Consciousness, Simulated Reality).  

Of the two, NCVR seems a much more straightforward extrapolation of current technology: it is easy to imagine current visual and audio VR becoming more high-resolution, rich, and convincing even over the next couple of decades.  Replicating senses of touch, taste, smell, proprioception, equilibrioception, hunger, etc., will be quite a bit harder, probably requiring neural implants and an exquisite understanding of human sense perception – but such implants exist now in very crude form and their extrapolation does not seem in tension with other basic ideas of how reality works.

ACSR is much more contentious, requiring the assumption not just that true Artificial Intelligence will be developed, but that it can take a form that experiences *just what we do.*  It is generally assumed that this would occur via the mechanism of simulating (or ""uploading"") a human brain's operation into a simulation of that operation. (Though it might occur via other paths.)  Nobody knows on what timescale this is possible, and it is possible (and believed by some) that there are fundamental obstacles such simulations/uploads.  Further, the uploaded mind must exist in a reality that is carefully enough simulated to convincingly replicate a full physical reality (just as in the NCVR case.) 

Both modes raise a very tricky challenge of deciding *how much* to simulate.  The sensory stream of an individual mind should be no challenge several decades from now.  On the other hand, an ab-initio full simulation of physical reality for a region even of solar-system size seems likely to require a completely prohibitive amount of computing power using any foreseeable technology. (There are a *lot* of interesting considerations here, that would take much more space to flesh out.)

As a definite question, we'll ask something about the distant but not impossibly-distant future:

** By the year 2100, will computer simulations be run with sufficiently high fidelity to the current consensus physical reality experienced by Metaculus users in 2016-2018 that all of the participation in Metaculus thus far and over the coming ~2 years could in practice be so simulated?**

By implication, if P is the probability given assigned to this question, and Q is the probability that the experience of Metaculus *will* in fact be simulated given the capability of doing so, then the reader of this question could reasonably attribute a probability exceeding PQ/(1+PQ) to being part of that simulation.  The probability could be *much* higher if many, many such simulations are run, and a flat probability measure is taken over the simulated and real beings, per the discussion in [Part I](http://www.metaculus.com/questions/278/are-we-in-a-simulated-reality-part-i/).

Note that the question is stronger than whether *any* convincing NCVR is possible, or whether ACSR is possible at all: in particular, the NCVR would have to include implanting of false memories (of a life before Metaculus), and ACSR would have to stand up to close scrutiny by all Metaculus participants for two years, some of which are scientists studying the nature of their reality in quite rigorous method and detail.",,False,,comp-sci--complexity;human-sci--cognitivescience;phys-sci--astro-and-cosmo;phys-sci--general;tech--general,True,,,,,,

The steady growth of per-capita wealth and population has thus lead to a steady growth in the number of animals killed each year worldwide.

Arguments based on health, animal welfare, resource usage, and environmental impact have led to the steady growth of vegetarian and meat-reduced diets.

The landmark discovery has since become tangled in a bitter patent dispute, however, that could shape how the technology can be developed going forward.

CRISPR stands for ""clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats."" First discovered [in bacteria](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC213968/) in 1987, CRISPR refers to a system used by cells to recognize and excise foreign DNA, such as from viruses. The CRISPR/Cas9 technology introduces a strand of RNA that guides the Cas9 enzyme to specific locations in the genome and precisely cuts DNA, like a pair of scissors. The target gene is either replaced with a new genetic sequence or is deleted entirely, and the change to the genetic sequence of that cell is permanent. CRISPR/Cas9 has already been used in [many](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3627607/) [organisms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3686313/) and, once fully developed, could point the way toward repairing faulty genes in human [genetic disorders.](http://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-how-crispr-will-change-the-world/)

First, however, CRISPR/Cas9 must endure a patent fight to decide which of the several scientists involved in the technology's discovery can claim the sole right to license CRISPR/Cas9 to laboratories and reap the profits of such exclusivity.

The key players: 
[Jennifer Doudna](http://rna.berkeley.edu/) of [UC Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu/). Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier published the [first CRISPR/Cas9 paper](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/337/6096/816) in 2012, describing use of the technique in a bacterial cell - a prokaryotic cell without a nucleus. Doudna's patent [application](http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=32&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PG01&s2=Doudna.IN.&OS=IN/Doudna&RS=IN/Doudna) for the technique, filed first, is still pending.

[Feng Zhang](https://mcgovern.mit.edu/principal-investigators/feng-zhang) of the [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/) in Cambridge, Mass. Independent of Doudna and Charpentier, Zhang published a [paper](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/339/6121/819.long) in early 2013 that first showed use of CRISPR/Cas9 in a eukaryotic cell, or a cell with a nucleus. Zhang had his patent application expedited, however, and although he filed later than Doudna, his [patent](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=13&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=%22Zhang,+Feng%22.INNM.&s2=CRISPR.ABTX.&OS=IN/%22Zhang,+Feng%22+AND+ABST/CRISPR&RS=IN/%22Zhang,+Feng%22+AND+ABST/CRISPR) was awarded in 2014. Doudna's challenge to Zhang's patent triggered the current dispute, called an ""interference.""

A complicating wrinkle in the dispute is [a law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leahy-Smith_America_Invents_Act) that took effect on March 16, 2013 that changed patent priority from ""first to invent"" to ""first to file."" The trouble in this case is that Zhang's filings may contain inventions made both before and after March 16, complicating interpretation of which rules apply to the patent.

Zhang's argument is that although Doudna's group showed an earlier use of the building blocks of CRISPR/Cas9, he first applied it in the actual target system, the eukaryotic cell. Doudna's argument is that her earlier use of the technology and filing of a patent establishes priority, and that Zhang's lab may have misrepresented when they developed key steps of the method. [Other parties](https://www.broadinstitute.org/what-broad/areas-focus/project-spotlight/crispr-timeline) are also claiming a share of the credit for discovering CRISPR.

At stake is the right to own the CRISPR/Cas9 enterprise, technology that would be licensed out to laboratories that want to engage in gene editing. Several groups, including Doudna and Zhang, have started gene editing companies that, together, have raised more than $1 billion in funding. The patent could be worth an untold amount of money, given the excitement and promise of CRISPR/Cas9. 

Opening motions in the case were filed in March. On November 17, 2016, a three-judge panel will hear oral arguments. A decision could take months, however, and any appeals could extend the process of rendering a final judgment.

***Will a decision be issued in the CRISPR/Cas9 patent interference case by the end of 2017 that overturns Zhang's 2014 patent?***

This questions will resolve as positive if the [US Patent and Trademark Office](http://www.uspto.gov/) three-judge panel issues its decision regarding the rights to the CRISPR/Cas9 patent on or before December 31, 2017, and that decision overturns at least some claims of the Zhang 2014 patent. This does not speak to appeals of the decision, and the question resolves as negative if a settlement or other event precludes judgement, or if the judgement confers some benefits to Doudna but leaves all claims in the original Zhang patent standing.",,False,,bio--bioengineering;bio--cell-and-molecular;bio--genetics;bio--medicine;law--patents;patents--biotech,True,,,,,True,

/questions/286/airships-by-2019/,Airships by 2019?,forecast,286,0.0,,RESOLVED,0.43,"Blimps. Dirigibles. Zeppelins. Airships have been around since the 1900s, but they have struggled to find their niche among faster, smaller, and safer aircraft. Early zeppelin pioneers envisioned airships filling the skies as a major form of transportation, and the Empire State Building was even [designed to accommodate](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/26/realestate/26scapes.html?_r=0) them but the [1937 Hindenburg disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindenburg_disaster) quashed that dream. (Seemingly every movie ever envisioning an alternative timeline for the US has zeppelins all over!)

Airships haven't died out completely, though. The [Goodyear blimp](http://www.goodyearblimp.com/) is one popular example. (Terminology note: A [blimp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blimp) is an airship with a non-rigid envelope, supported only by the pressure of the enclosed lighter-than-air gas. Semi-rigid or rigid envelope frames are called [Zeppelins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeppelin).) 

Since 2006, [Lockheed Martin](http://www.lockheedmartin.com/) has been developing a semi-rigid airship called the [LMH-1](http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/products/HybridAirship.html). The three-lobed airship, filled with helium, is designed as a cargo ship that can deliver up to 47,000 pounds of cargo and 19 passengers to any place in the world without a need for paved roads or a landing runway. Today, such sites are typically accessed by helicopter. But the LMH-1's operating cost is estimated as 7-10 times less than a helicopter. The airship promises access to the two-thirds of the earth's land area inaccessible by paved roads.

Lockheed Martin's target markets for the LMH-1 are the oil, gas, and mining industries. Mine and well sites can be located in remote areas, and companies must either build the costly and environmentally damaging infrastructure to access the sites, or deliver people and materials by helicopter. Airships provide a cheaper alternative. All they need is a 2,400 foot landing area, less than half a mile long. Using an air cushion landing system, the LMH-1 can land on water as well. 

In parallel, UK-based [Hybrid Air Vehicles](https://www.hybridairvehicles.com/) has developed the Airlander 10, a similar airship that was [certified for flight](http://www.heavyliftpfi.com/news/airlander-cleared-for-take-off.html) in April 2016. The Airlander 10 can carry up to 22,000 pounds of cargo.

In March 2016, [Straightline Aviation](http://www.straightlineaviation.com/) placed an order for 12 LMH-1 airships, at a cost of $40 million each. (By comparison, Boeing's heavy-lift [Chinook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_CH-47_Chinook) cargo helicopter costs $38.5 million.) Deliveries are expected in 2018. Although Straightline is still working to acquire customers in the oil, gas, and mining industries, the company is targeting Alaskan oilfields formerly accessible only by ice roads. Lockheed Martin expects to produce around 500 airships in the next ten years. Despite all these positive signs, however, bringing a major new type of aircraft into use is no small feat.

***Will an oil, gas, or mining company employ hybrid airship transportation by the end of 2018?***

To resolve positively, a credible media story or corporate announcement must indicate that a company engaged in oil, gas, or mineral extraction has begun using an LMH-1, Airlander 10, or other hybrid airship for commercial operations on or before December 31, 2018.

Unfortunately, human activities are causing an increasing amount of light pollution, which prevent some populations at various locations on Earth from seeing the night sky as it once was. Mainly arising from urban areas, the production of excessive light due to inefficiency and unnecessity has significant [negative effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_pollution).

A fairly comprehensive and quantitative assessment of light pollution is described in [this article](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/6/e1600377.full.pdf+html) published by the AAAS.  With the help of light pollution propagation software, data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite, and measurements made by the Sky Quality Meter, a team of researcher created the world atlas of artificial sky luminance,  finding that the Milky Way is not visible for over one-third of humanity! This includes 60% of Europeans and about 80% of North Americans. In some entire (small) countries such as Singapore and San Marino have the Galaxy is entirely blocked. 

To help reduce this pollution, several programs have started to promote awareness and provide suggested solutions.

However, light pollution currently is not as well advocated as other types pollutions such as air, water, even noise pollution. 

The international dark-sky association is one of the leading organizations promoting public awareness on light pollution by inviting citizen-scientist to take measurements of night sky brightness using a smartphone or a computer.

Snakes bite around 5 million people each year, resulting in about 100,000 deaths worldwide. Bites are traditionally treated with antivenoms, which are snake-specific, expensive, temperature-sensitive, and often require medical expertise to administer, conditions that make snakebite difficult to treat outside a hospital. [An effective antidote, in contrast, would be both heat-stable and broadly effective](https://www.statnews.com/2016/03/11/snakebite-antidote/?s_campaign=stat:rss), interfering with venom’s destructive biochemical effects, which might include paralysis, excessive clotting or bleeding, necrosis, or a combination.

Lewin’s research team has identified varespladib and varespladib methyl, off-patent drugs originally developed as an anti-inflammatory, as potential antidotes. [These drugs inhibit an enzyme called sPLA2](http://www.calacademy.org/press/releases/new-snakebite-research-pits-drugs-against-deadly-venoms-shows-promising-step-towards), which is produced in the human body during inflammation and is also a component of snake venom. The drugs have been tested in humans for other uses, but never obtained FDA approval.

Early research shows that the drugs are effective in neutralizing sPLA2 in a large variety of snake venoms.

/questions/291/funding-for-a-study-of-anti-aging-properties-of-the-diabetes-drug-metformin/,Funding for a study of anti-aging properties of the diabetes drug Metformin?,forecast,291,0.0,,RESOLVED,0.6,"Advancing age brings with it a host of health risks, and while modern medicine works to treat many of the conditions associated with aging, no therapy is yet approved to treat aging as an underlying condition.

Slow aging, some researchers say, and you can extend a person's ""healthspan,"" or years of relative health. Delaying aging could also delay the onset of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, cognitive decline, and other conditions. To spur development of anti-aging therapeutics, however, researchers must first convince the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve aging as a disease or pharmaceutical target, also called an ""indication.""

A trial balloon in this effort is a study called [Targeting Aging with Metformin](http://tame.healthspanpolicy.org/), or ""TAME."" The study, led by [Nir Barzilai](http://www.einstein.yu.edu/faculty/484/nir-barzilai/) of the [Albert Einstein College of Medicine](http://www.einstein.yu.edu/), aims to enroll 3,000 people in a double-blind controlled experiment to see if the diabetes drug metformin can extend the human healthspan and lifespan. Metformin, considered the first line of defense against Type 2 diabetes, lowers blood sugar and increases insulin sensitivity. At around 35 cents per pill, it's relatively inexpensive. 

Studies have found an intriguing side effect of metformin, however. The drug increased the lifespan of [worms](http://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674(13)00267-5) and [some mice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3736576/). A UK study of patient data suggested a [possible lowered risk](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2014359/) of cardiovascular disease in metformin-treated diabetes patients. Another study of patient data suggests that diabetes patients in their 70s, treated with metformin, experienced around [15% less mortality](http://healthspancampaign.org/2015/04/28/dr-nir-barzilai-on-the-tame-study/) than their diabetic peers treated with other methods. Scientists think the drug may reduce inflammation and slow the process of cell senescence, a component of aging. 

Although TAME shows promise, and the protocol was [approved](http://www.newsweek.com/2015/12/25/diabetes-drug-could-be-anti-aging-miracle-404370.html) by the FDA in June 2016, the program is unfunded. Costs are expected to reach $50-65 million. Without funding, TAME cannot proceed.

Funding could come from private or public sources. Pharmaceutical companies have the deep pockets that TAME needs, but may be reluctant to invest in the study since a [previous anti-aging effort](http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2013/03/12/glaxosmithkline-shuts-down-sirtris-five-years-after-720m-buyout/#) cost more than $700 million and has been fruitless so far in clinical trials. And, with metformin already established as a drug, pharmaceutical companies cannot exclusively profit from it as they would with a newly developed therapeutic.

Another possible funding source is a line in the US Department of Defense's budget called the ""Peer Reviewed Medical Research Program,"" (PRMRP) which distributes funding for basic medical research. For 2016, Congress appropriated [$278 million](http://cdmrp.army.mil/pubs/press/2016/16prmrppreann.shtml) for the program. Visitors to TAME's website are encouraged to [write to their congressional representative](https://healthspanpolicy.org/metformin-campaign/) to encourage further appropriations of $13 million per year for the PRMRP, funds that could support the initial years of TAME.

According to the [House Committee on the Budget](http://budget.house.gov/budgetprocess/budgettimetable.htm), any action on the FY 2017 budget will be in place by June 30, 2017. PRMRP proposals are typically submitted [in the spring]((http://cdmrp.army.mil/pubs/press/2016/16prmrppreann.shtml)), in advance of the fiscal year beginning on October 1.

***Will TAME secure enough funding, public or private, to proceed by October 1, 2017?***

It is very simple in its formulation - a finite set of internal states, an infinitely long tape on which characters can be written, and a finite set of transition rules dictating how a current state and current character map to: writing a new character, possibly moving the tape, and changing from one of the internal states to another. Although simple and stripped-down, the functions it can compute are equivalent to those of other models of digital computers under assumptions of unlimited time and ""tape"". 

Theorems can be proven characterizing the behavior of very simple Turing machines - for example, a machine with only one internal state that (when it is in that state) prints a character and moves the tape ahead will never stop.

It's also known as a consequence of Godel's Incompleteness Theorem that there exist Turing machines complex enough that their behavior cannot be characterized by proof given the usual axioms of set theory (ZFC with the Axiom of Choice).

In May 2016, Adam Yedidia and Scott Aaronson [published a paper](http://www.scottaaronson.com/busybeaver.pdf) demonstrating a Turing machine with 7,918 states (one tape, two possible symbols) that has behavior that is unprovable in a particular sense: the machine cannot be proven in ZFC to either run forever or not run forever, assuming that a slightly stronger formulation of set theory (Stationary Ramsey Property) is itself consistent.

We ask not about the final outcome of this suit, but merely about the outcomes of the pending motions. **Will this suit continue to phase II of its schedule?**

This question will resolve as positive if, by May 2017,

* the court denies the government's motion to dismiss, **and**
* the court grants certification of a class for the plaintiffs, in whole or in part.

For timely resolution, we will consider *only the first rulings* on these motions by the [DC federal trial court][ddc] (where the case is being held), and ignore any appeal. These rulings will be available on… PACER, of course.

Solar power utilizes photovoltaic technology to convert light energy into electricity. Once the solar panels are manufactured, they produce no carbon dioxide emissions. Installations range from single-family rooftop residential panels all the way up to large utility-scale solar farms. 

To help clean energy gain wide adoption and to spur the creation of jobs in the green economy, the U.S. Department of Energy launched the SunShot initiative with the goal of decreasing the price of solar power by 75% between 2010 and 2020. 

In 2010, [residential solar power installations cost $6.20 per watt (direct current), commercial installations ran $5.00 per watt, and utility-scale installations cost  $4.10 per watt.](http://energy.gov/eere/sunshot/downloads/role-advancements-photovoltaic-efficiency-reliability-and-costs)

SunShot, through targeted project [funding opportunities](http://energy.gov/eere/sunshot/financial-opportunities), seeks to [reduce the cost of solar technology](http://energy.gov/eere/sunshot/reducing-photovoltaic-costs), reduce the [cost of integrating solar panels with electrical grids](http://energy.gov/eere/sunshot/systems-integration), and accelerate the spread of solar power throughout the country.

As summarized in [this recent story](http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/energy/a22678/em-drive-cannae-cubesat-reactionless/), the tantalizing experiments involve putting radiation in a cavity and finding that – somehow – this creates a net force on the cavity.

While not every form of blindness is treatable or preventable, the article lists several methods in development to restore at least some vision. Although the goal is to end preventable blindness before 2020, the technology is still in testing and the greatest barrier is delivering treatments to the people who need them.

Two treatment methods focus on repairing damage in the retina itself. [Gene therapy](http://www.nature.com/news/success-against-blindness-encourages-gene-therapy-researchers-1.18603) targets genetic disorders in eyes by inserting a functional replacement gene into a carrier virus, which incorporates itself into retinal cells. [Stem cell therapy](http://www.blindness.org/blog/index.php/arvo-2016-what-does-it-take-to-develop-a-stem-cell-therapy-for-the-retina/#more-4823) aims to replenish damaged or degraded retinas by placing targeted populations of stem cells, which can differentiate into any cell type in the body, in a position to form new rods and cones, the cells essential to sight. Gene therapy is already in clinical use in patients, while stem cell therapy is still in the trial stage.

Another route is a [retinal implant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_implant). Bionic eyes work just like natural eyes, by collecting and focusing light and relaying the light signals to the brain. Only a handful of people have received an implant so far, and the images produced are little more than areas of light and dark - but the technology is improving.

The World Health Organization reports that [80%](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs282/en/) of all blindness is preventable or treatable and that the [only major remaining non-treatable cause](http://www.who.int/blindness/causes/en/) of blindness is age-related macular degeneration.

Except for a one-day reprieve in late August, daily averages have been above 400 ppm [since December 2015](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/programs/keelingcurve/). The milestone was [noted, analyzed, and mourned](http://climate.nasa.gov/400ppmquotes/) by climate scientists who speculated that their children and grandchildren might never again see carbon dioxide concentrations drip below 400 ppm.

Carbon dioxide concentration has been climbing ever since measurements began at Hawaii's [Mauna Loa Observatory](http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/obop/mlo/) in 1958. And the climb is [accelerating](http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/gr.html): in the 1960s and 70s, carbon dioxide concentration rose by around 1 ppm per year. Last year the concentration growth rate was 3 ppm per year.

The milestone of 400 ppm is mostly symbolic, but signifies that earth is rapidly approaching the 450 ppm threshold seen by [some](http://climate.nasa.gov/400ppmquotes/) as a climate stabilization target.

The point at which the global carbon dioxide concentration is projected to reach 500 ppm depends on which so-called ""[representative concentration pathway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_Concentration_Pathways)"" humanity follows.

It's a disease of the pancreas, an organ that, among other functions, monitors the body's blood sugar levels and releases the hormone insulin as needed to keep blood sugar under control.

Diabetes results from a malfunction in the pancreas, requiring people with the disease to monitor their own blood sugar levels and deliver insulin as needed, either through a hypodermic syringe or an insulin pump, which requires user input as to when and how much insulin to deliver.

In September 2016, a device from Medtronic [gained FDA approval](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-diabetes-medtronic-idUSKCN11Z04Y) as the first artificial pancreas, an automated insulin pump that automatically carries out blood sugar detection and insulin delivery without the user needing to manually program a pump. It is designed around existing insulin pump technology but with an additional algorithms to automatically regulate blood sugar. This is a boon to people with diabetes, particularly for night-time insulin delivery.

Some human input is still required, but only for large meals, exercise, and recalibrating the device with manual blood sugar testing every 12 hours.

After a [sweeping ban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Protocol) on ozone-depleting chemicals in 1987, the degradation of the ozone layer appears to have slowed, and is now poised for recovery.

Ozone is a molecule composed of three oxygen atoms. A layer of ozone sits about 6 miles above the earth, in the stratosphere, and protects earth from harmful wavelengths of ultraviolet radiation. Ozone reacts very easily with other chemicals, however. Chlorine and bromine can knock an oxygen atom off of an ozone molecule, leaving an oxygen atom that cannot perform the same protective function as ozone. 

Chloroflurocarbons, chemicals used in refrigeration, are particularly effective in destroying ozone molecules. After a seasonal hole in the ozone layer was first discovered in 1985, however, international cooperation yielded an agreement in 1987 to phase out ozone-depleting chemicals.  Since then, the amount of chlorine in the atmosphere that poses a danger to ozone [has peaked](http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/research/themes/o3/) and is beginning to decline. The size of the ozone hole reached its [largest recorded extent in 2006](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/09/11/try-to-keep-up-earths-ozone-layer-is-recovering-but-that-is-making-global-warming-worse/), at 30 million square kilometers, but hasn't surpassed that number since.

In mid-January of 2016, two Caltech Professors -- Konstantin Batygin and Mike Brown -- kicked the news media into high gear by predicting the existence of a new, but as-yet unseen, planet in the outer solar system. They asserted that Neptune et al.'s erstwhile sibling has an orbital period of about 20,000 years, and a super-Earth mass more than sufficient to bring the planet count back up to nine.

Once just a mathematical curiosity, its existence may have been experimentally confirmed by a team of physicists who observed predicted time crystal behavior in an interacting spin chain of trapped atomic ions. The work is reported in a [pre-print](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08684) submitted to arXiv in September 2016. 

Initially, many doubted that such [quantum systems](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602541/physicists-create-worlds-first-time-crystal/) could exist for the unusual property of periodic motion in the ground state. Like ordinary crystals which form repeating patterns in the crystal structure created by [spontaneous translational symmetry breaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_symmetry_breaking) in three dimensions, time crystals extend to the fourth dimension: time. Observing time crystals would imply observing the breaking of [time translation symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_(physics)). Time crystals exhibit repetition (crystalline behavior) in both space and time, and the growth of repeating lattices in time does not consume nor produce any energy despite of perpetual motion in the ground state.

But the required spontaneously broken time translation symmetry had not been observed before, and the lack of a precise definition for time crystals created difficulty in the past for realizing such a physical system. Previously, [researchers showed](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2143) that when they considered both the ground state and states in thermal equilibrium, time translation symmetry could not be broken. 

Later, another team, using the idea of a non-equilibrium driven system, showed time translation symmetry can be spontaneously broken in a large class of many-body-localized driven systems with discrete time translation symmetry.

The cells, called microglia, cleared away the plaques, restoring memory function in [75 percent of the mice, with no apparent detrimental effects](http://www.sciencealert.com/new-alzheimer-s-treatment-fully-restores-memory-function).

Of particular concern is the species *Aedes aegypti* which is the primary transmitter of Zika virus in the US.

Two approaches to controlling mosquito populations are moving forward. One involves genetically modifying male mosquitoes such that any of their offspring will die as larvae. [Oxitec](https://www.wired.com/2016/11/florida-votes-release-millions-zika-fighting-mosquitos/) is pursuing this strategy, and has recieved preliminary approval from the FDA to proceed with a trial in the US following previous trials in [Brazil, Panama, and the Cayman Islands](http://www.oxitec.com/board-florida-keys-mosquito-control-district-approves-investigational-agreement-monroe-county/).

Another approach does not rely on genetic modification. Mosquitoes infected with [*Wolbachia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolbachia#Applications_to_human-related_infections) bacterial parasites cannot transmit disease, because the parasite interferes with viral replication in the mosquito's cells. *Wolbachia* can also be used to sterilize mosquitoes, preventing them from reproducing.

ICBMs are typically defined as capable of traveling [more than 5,500 km](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercontinental_ballistic_missile) (3,400 mi). Missiles with shorter ranges are defined as intermediate-range ballistic missiles, the category in which North Korea's successfully-tested [Musudan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwasong-10) missile falls. 

Early development of ICBMs by the United States and Russia paralleled the space race, since the same missiles in development to deliver nuclear warheads were also used as launch vehicles in the Mercury and Gemini programs and in the Russian counterparts of the same programs. 

North Korea's [Taepodong rocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taepodong-2), with a range up to 6,000 km, has similarly been used for space launches, although it's unlikely this rocket was designed to carry a nuclear warhead. Instead, North Korea's two ICBMs possibly in development are the [KN-08 and the longer-range KN-14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KN-08#New_KN-08_based_missile:_KN-14). 

An ICBM test is likely to have international consequences, particularly in light of U.S. President Donald Trump's [assertion](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-north-korea-nuclear-icbm-wont-happen/story?id=44517768) that the test ""won't happen.""

***When will North Korea test-launch an ICBM?***

Looking to push the limits of human performance, Nike [announced in December 2016](http://news.nike.com/news/2-hour-marathon) a concerted effort, called Breaking2, to complete a marathon in under two hours in 2017. The Oregon company enlisted the help of three of the world's best marathoners:  Eritrean Zersenay Tadese, Ethiopian Lelisa Desisa, and Kenyan Eliud Kipchoge. As of this writing, the date of the attempt had not yet been announced.

The world-record marathon time is already a major human achievement, and pushing against the two-hour mark requires shaving off an additional 3% off the world-record time. Nike is engineering the perfect conditions for a marathon, including a cool track, aerodynamic clothing, and the perfect nutrition and training regimen.

Despite all Nike can do, however, they may be limited by the upper limits of what the body is capable of. A [1991 paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2022559) hypothesized that the fastest a human could possibly run a marathon was 1:57:58.

The sea is known by different names in the countries surrounding it, primarily China, Vietnam, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Each of the nations has [asserted territorial claims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_disputes_in_the_South_China_Sea) over portions of the sea and its islands, claims which overlap. At stake is control of the busy fishing and shipping region, as well as the vast estimated oil and gas reserves in the South China Sea floor.

The [Spratly Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spratly_Islands) compose some of the most hotly contested territory. The 14 islands and around 100 reefs and atolls are occupied by military personnel from China, Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam.

Disputes over the South China Sea date back to the 1940s, and continue today. China has emerged as the most aggressive claimant, and has built military fortifications, airstrips, and artificial islands in the sea. In 2011 an Indian military vessel in the sea [was warned via radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_disputes_in_the_South_China_Sea#Chinese_objection_to_Indian_naval_presence_and_oil_exploration) that it was entering Chinese waters. 

In July 2016, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea [ruled in favor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines_v._China) of the Philippines that China had no historical right to its claimed territory, typically known as the ""nine-dash-line"" map. Neither China nor Taiwan has accepted the ruling.

Comments from world leaders suggest that the territorial disputes in the sea could erupt into armed conflict. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said [in his confirmation hearings](http://www.vox.com/world/2017/1/13/14264112/tillerson-south-china-sea-trump): “We’re going to have to send China a clear signal that, first, the island-building stops and, second, your access to those islands also is not going to be allowed.”

In response, from China's Global Times newspaper: ""If Trump's diplomatic team shapes future Sino-US ties as it is doing now, the two sides had better prepare for a military clash.""

TIllerson's remarks have been walked back, particularly by Mattis' statements on his Asian tour, yet tensions in the region remain high.

Trump's success and wealth are cornerstones of his brand, although his true net worth is currently unknown.

The extent of his foreign holdings, which could become conflicts of interest as he interacts with governments in his official role as president.

In particular, the returns would detail Trump's holdings in Russia. The president's [relationship with Russia](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/feb/22/all-possible-ties-between-trump-and-russia/) has been under scrutiny since the campaign. 

Although President Trump has continued to refuse calls to release his returns, mechanisms are in place to require their release. [Congress can subpoena the records from the IRS](http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/susan-collins-intelligence-committee-subpoena-trump-tax-returns-needed), which would then become public information. Such a subpoena could be part of an investigation into any of the above issues, particularly an investigation into dealings with Russia.

The stakes are high, and the information in the tax returns could be politically devastating to the president, if it indeed contains proof of unethical behavior or evidence contradicting the president's assertions of no wrongdoing in foreign dealings. One writer has suggested that [a subpoena of Trump's tax information would trigger the president's resignation](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/getting-rid-of-trump-easy-neither-impeachment-nor_us_58aa697ae4b0b0e1e0e20d2e), as he would rather vacate the office than see his tax returns come to light.

Quantum computers exploit quantum effects of entanglement and superposition in systems acting as ""qubits"" (quantum bits) to efficiently perform calculations that are inefficient using classical computers.  Most famous is the ability to factor very large numbers, the difficulty of which underlies many current cryptography systems.  But there is much more: quantum computers could, for example, efficiently simulate *quantum systems* in chemistry and biology, leading to dramatically more powerful tools for designing materials, drugs, etc.

The basic theory behind quantum computers is well understood, and computers with a handful of qubits have been created as of 2016.  It is generally (though not universally) believed that only technological barriers exist to creating large-scale quantum computers. 

An interesting threshold is 50 qubits, at which quantum computers could outpace contemporary supercomputers in at least some applications.  Google has [recently stated](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603495/10-breakthrough-technologies-2017-practical-quantum-computers/) a goal of a 49 (7x7 array) qubit device in 2018, and IBM [has announced a similar goal.](https://arstechnica.co.uk/gadgets/2017/03/ibm-q-50-qubit-quantum-computer/)

We'll take this question to have a double meaning.  It resolves positively if Jon personally surrenders, *or* proposes marriage, to Daenerys in an episode airing in 2017.  An alliance does not count.

The amount of energy coming from renewable sources is a paltry [3.5%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_energy_consumption) of the world's power needs. [228 GW](http://www.iea-pvps.org/index.php?id=3&eID=dam_frontend_push&docID=3390) of that power comes from solar energy. 

Europe is currently the leader in solar or photovoltaic (PV) capacity, producing around [40%](http://www.iea-pvps.org/index.php?id=3&eID=dam_frontend_push&docID=3390) of the world's solar energy. In terms of growth, China and Japan are the global leaders, together comprising [51% of growth in PV installations in 2015](http://www.iea-pvps.org/index.php?id=3&eID=dam_frontend_push&docID=3390).

Growth of PV installations over the past five years has been phenomenal, with a growth rate of between [29 and 42%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_of_photovoltaics) every year. Projections of future growth are equally impressive, ranging from around [400 to nearly 700 GW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_of_photovoltaics#Global_short-term_forecast_.282020.29) of PV capacity in 2020. 

Projections have [historically underestimated](http://www.theenergycollective.com/onclimatechangepolicy/286586/why-have-iea-s-projections-renewables-growth-been-so-much-lower-out-tur) estimate actual growth, however.

/questions/455/if-you-die-today-and-get-cryonically-frozen-will-you-wake-up/,"If you die today and get cryonically frozen, will you ""wake up""?",forecast,455,0.0,,RESOLVED,0.05,"Individual death has long been attributed a 100% long-term probability.  But for just as long, there have been desires, schemes, and claims of ways to prolong life indefinitely.  In moderns times, three examples include anti-aging research (the ultimate version of which would be personal immortality), digital mind-upload, and cryonics.  The latter is the subject of this question.

The basic idea is simple: upon bodily death, preserve as much structure (especially in the brain) as possible via immediate freezing, and maintain this until medical technology had advanced to the degree that the individual can be fully reconstructed – memories, personality and all – using this preserved structure. (For an entertaining long read check out [this Wait-but-why piece](http://waitbutwhy.com/2016/03/cryonics.html).)

The ability to quickly freeze tissue in a structure-preserving way has steadily improved; an [existing question](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/437/when-will-the-large-brain-preservation-prize-be-awarded-by-the-brain-preservation-foundation/) regarding the ""large brain preservation prize"" discusses some of the advances.  Many questions remain however, including:  Is it even *in principle* possible to reconstruct an individual human mind out of a frozen brain?  If so, how much accuracy in preservation is necessary? Do current techniques have the requisite accuracy?  How advanced will the reconstruction technology be, and when would/might that exist?  etc., etc.

Let's assume that an individual as of the reading of the question signs up with one of the top three (by number of currently preserved individuals).  

*** What is the probability that the individual will ""wake up"" in essentially the same or better form than they died? ***

We'll consider success if the revived individual has full mental faculties, an essentially complete set of memories of their former life, and a personality that is at least difficult for them or others to discern from the original.  We'll assume for these purposes that the individual's last heartbeat (at least for some time) occurs in a hospital or similar setting where the body can be immediately cooled and moved (if not there already) to a facility for cryonic preservation, and that the individual dies with a relatively healthy brain intact.

*Note:* like a few other Metaculus questions, we don't expect this to actually resolve.  Rather it is a ""headline"" question that could fold in the results of others.
